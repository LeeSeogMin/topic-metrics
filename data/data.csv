"Quantum mechanics is a fundamental theory that describes the behavior of nature at and below the scale of atoms.: 1.1  It is the foundation of all quantum physics, which includes quantum chemistry, quantum field theory, quantum technology, and quantum information science.
Quantum mechanics can describe many systems that classical physics cannot",Quantum Mechanics
"Classical physics can describe many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic and (optical) microscopic) scale, but is not sufficient for describing them at very small submicroscopic (atomic and subatomic) scales",Quantum Mechanics
"Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation, valid at large (macroscopic/microscopic) scale.
Quantum systems have bound states that are quantized to discrete values of energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities, in contrast to classical systems where these quantities can be measured continuously",Quantum Mechanics
"Measurements of quantum systems show characteristics of both particles and waves (wave–particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).
Quantum mechanics arose gradually from theories to explain observations that could not be reconciled with classical physics, such as Max Planck's solution in 1900 to the black-body radiation problem, and the correspondence between energy and frequency in Albert Einstein's 1905 paper, which explained the photoelectric effect",Quantum Mechanics
"These early attempts to understand microscopic phenomena, now known as the ""old quantum theory"", led to the full development of quantum mechanics in the mid-1920s by Niels Bohr, Erwin Schrödinger, Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, Paul Dirac and others",Quantum Mechanics
The modern theory is formulated in various specially developed mathematical formalisms,Quantum Mechanics
"In one of them, a mathematical entity called the wave function provides information, in the form of probability amplitudes, about what measurements of a particle's energy, momentum, and other physical properties may yield.


== Overview and fundamental concepts ==
Quantum mechanics allows the calculation of properties and behaviour of physical systems",Quantum Mechanics
"It is typically applied to microscopic systems: molecules, atoms and sub-atomic particles",Quantum Mechanics
"It has been demonstrated to hold for complex molecules with thousands of atoms, but its application to human beings raises philosophical problems, such as Wigner's friend, and its application to the universe as a whole remains speculative",Quantum Mechanics
Predictions of quantum mechanics have been verified experimentally to an extremely high degree of accuracy,Quantum Mechanics
"For example, the refinement of quantum mechanics for the interaction of light and matter, known as quantum electrodynamics (QED), has been shown to agree with experiment to within 1 part in 1012 when predicting the magnetic properties of an electron.
A fundamental feature of the theory is that it usually cannot predict with certainty what will happen, but only give probabilities",Quantum Mechanics
"Mathematically, a probability is found by taking the square of the absolute value of a complex number, known as a probability amplitude",Quantum Mechanics
"This is known as the Born rule, named after physicist Max Born",Quantum Mechanics
"For example, a quantum particle like an electron can be described by a wave function, which associates to each point in space a probability amplitude",Quantum Mechanics
Applying the Born rule to these amplitudes gives a probability density function for the position that the electron will be found to have when an experiment is performed to measure it,Quantum Mechanics
This is the best the theory can do; it cannot say for certain where the electron will be found,Quantum Mechanics
"The Schrödinger equation relates the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to one moment of time to the collection of probability amplitudes that pertain to another.: 67–87 
One consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is a tradeoff in predictability between measurable quantities",Quantum Mechanics
"The most famous form of this uncertainty principle says that no matter how a quantum particle is prepared or how carefully experiments upon it are arranged, it is impossible to have a precise prediction for a measurement of its position and also at the same time for a measurement of its momentum.: 427–435 

Another consequence of the mathematical rules of quantum mechanics is the phenomenon of quantum interference, which is often illustrated with the double-slit experiment",Quantum Mechanics
"In the basic version of this experiment, a coherent light source, such as a laser beam, illuminates a plate pierced by two parallel slits, and the light passing through the slits is observed on a screen behind the plate.: 102–111 : 1.1–1.8  The wave nature of light causes the light waves passing through the two slits to interfere, producing bright and dark bands on the screen – a result that would not be expected if light consisted of classical particles",Quantum Mechanics
"However, the light is always found to be absorbed at the screen at discrete points, as individual particles rather than waves; the interference pattern appears via the varying density of these particle hits on the screen",Quantum Mechanics
"Furthermore, versions of the experiment that include detectors at the slits find that each detected photon passes through one slit (as would a classical particle), and not through both slits (as would a wave).: 109  However, such experiments demonstrate that particles do not form the interference pattern if one detects which slit they pass through",Quantum Mechanics
"In addition to light, electrons, atoms, and molecules are all found to exhibit the same dual behavior when fired towards a double slit.

Another non-classical phenomenon predicted by quantum mechanics is quantum tunnelling: a particle that goes up against a potential barrier can cross it, even if its kinetic energy is smaller than the maximum of the potential",Quantum Mechanics
"Quantum tunnelling has several important consequences, enabling radioactive decay, nuclear fusion in stars, and applications such as scanning tunnelling microscopy, tunnel diode and tunnel field-effect transistor.
When quantum systems interact, the result can be the creation of quantum entanglement: their properties become so intertwined that a description of the whole solely in terms of the individual parts is no longer possible",Quantum Mechanics
"Erwin Schrödinger called entanglement ""...the characteristic trait of quantum mechanics, the one that enforces its entire departure from classical lines of thought""",Quantum Mechanics
"Quantum entanglement enables quantum computing and is part of quantum communication protocols, such as quantum key distribution and superdense coding",Quantum Mechanics
"Contrary to popular misconception, entanglement does not allow sending signals faster than light, as demonstrated by the no-communication theorem.
Another possibility opened by entanglement is testing for ""hidden variables"", hypothetical properties more fundamental than the quantities addressed in quantum theory itself, knowledge of which would allow more exact predictions than quantum theory provides",Quantum Mechanics
"A collection of results, most significantly Bell's theorem, have demonstrated that broad classes of such hidden-variable theories are in fact incompatible with quantum physics",Quantum Mechanics
"According to Bell's theorem, if nature actually operates in accord with any theory of local hidden variables, then the results of a Bell test will be constrained in a particular, quantifiable way",Quantum Mechanics
"Many Bell tests have been performed and they have shown results incompatible with the constraints imposed by local hidden variables.
It is not possible to present these concepts in more than a superficial way without introducing the mathematics involved; understanding quantum mechanics requires not only manipulating complex numbers, but also linear algebra, differential equations, group theory, and other more advanced subjects",Quantum Mechanics
"Accordingly, this article will present a mathematical formulation of quantum mechanics and survey its application to some useful and oft-studied examples.


== Mathematical formulation ==

In the mathematically rigorous formulation of quantum mechanics, the state of a quantum mechanical system is a vector 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
  
 belonging to a (separable) complex Hilbert space 
  
    
      
        
          
            H
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathcal {H}}}
  
",Quantum Mechanics
"This vector is postulated to be normalized under the Hilbert space inner product, that is, it obeys 
  
    
      
        ⟨
        ψ
        ,
        ψ
        ⟩
        =
        1
      
    
    {\displaystyle \langle \psi ,\psi \rangle =1}
  
, and it is well-defined up to a complex number of modulus 1 (the global phase), that is, 
  
    
      
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi }
  
 and 
  
    
      
        
          e
          
            i
            α
          
        
        ψ
      
    
    {\displaystyle e^{i\alpha }\psi }
  
 represent the same physical system",Quantum Mechanics
"In other words, the possible states are points in the projective space of a Hilbert space, usually called the complex projective space",Quantum Mechanics
"The exact nature of this Hilbert space is dependent on the system – for example, for describing position and momentum the Hilbert space is the space of complex square-integrable functions 
  
    
      
        
          L
          
            2
          
        
        (
        
          C
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle L^{2}(\mathbb {C} )}
  
, while the Hilbert space for the spin of a single proton is simply the space of two-dimensional complex vectors 
  
    
      
        
          
            C

    {\displaystyle \mathbb {C} ^{2}}
  
 with the usual inner product.
Physical quantities of interest – position, momentum, energy, spin – are represented by observables, which are Hermitian (more precisely, self-adjoint) linear operators acting on the Hilbert space",Quantum Mechanics
"A quantum state can be an eigenvector of an observable, in which case it is called an eigenstate, and the associated eigenvalue corresponds to the value of the observable in that eigenstate",Quantum Mechanics
"More generally, a quantum state will be a linear combination of the eigenstates, known as a quantum superposition",Quantum Mechanics
"When an observable is measured, the result will be one of its eigenvalues with probability given by the Born rule: in the simplest case the eigenvalue 
  
    
      
        λ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \lambda }
  
 is non-degenerate and the probability is given by 
  
    
      
        
          |
        
        ⟨

    {\displaystyle P_{\lambda }}
  
 is the projector onto its associated eigenspace",Quantum Mechanics
"In the continuous case, these formulas give instead the probability density.
After the measurement, if result 
  
    
      
        λ

, in the general case",Quantum Mechanics
The probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics thus stems from the act of measurement,Quantum Mechanics
This is one of the most difficult aspects of quantum systems to understand,Quantum Mechanics
"It was the central topic in the famous Bohr–Einstein debates, in which the two scientists attempted to clarify these fundamental principles by way of thought experiments",Quantum Mechanics
"In the decades after the formulation of quantum mechanics, the question of what constitutes a ""measurement"" has been extensively studied",Quantum Mechanics
"Newer interpretations of quantum mechanics have been formulated that do away with the concept of ""wave function collapse"" (see, for example, the many-worlds interpretation)",Quantum Mechanics
"The basic idea is that when a quantum system interacts with a measuring apparatus, their respective wave functions become entangled so that the original quantum system ceases to exist as an independent entity (see Measurement in quantum mechanics).


=== Time evolution of a quantum state ===
The time evolution of a quantum state is described by the Schrödinger equation:

  
    
      
        i
        ℏ
        
          
            ∂
            
              ∂
              t
            
          
        
        ψ
        (
        t
        )
        =
        H
        ψ
        (
        t
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\hbar {\frac {\partial }{\partial t}}\psi (t)=H\psi (t).}
  

Here 
  
    
      
        H
      
    
    {\displaystyle H}
  
 denotes the Hamiltonian, the observable corresponding to the total energy of the system, and 
  
    
      
        ℏ
      
    
    {\displaystyle \hbar }
  
 is the reduced Planck constant",Quantum Mechanics
"The constant 
  
    
      
        i
        ℏ
      
    
    {\displaystyle i\hbar }
  
 is introduced so that the Hamiltonian is reduced to the classical Hamiltonian in cases where the quantum system can be approximated by a classical system; the ability to make such an approximation in certain limits is called the correspondence principle.
The solution of this differential equation is given by

  
    
      
        ψ
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          e
          
            −
            i
            H
            t
            
              /
            
            ℏ
          
        
        ψ
        (
        0
        )
        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi (t)=e^{-iHt/\hbar }\psi (0).}
  

The operator 
  
    
      
        U
        (
        t
        )
        =
        
          e
          
            −
            i
            H
            t
            
              /
            
            ℏ
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle U(t)=e^{-iHt/\hbar }}
  
 is known as the time-evolution operator, and has the crucial property that it is unitary",Quantum Mechanics
"This time evolution is deterministic in the sense that – given an initial quantum state 
  
    
      
        ψ
        (
        0
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi (0)}
  
 – it makes a definite prediction of what the quantum state 
  
    
      
        ψ
        (
        t
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \psi (t)}
  
 will be at any later time.

Some wave functions produce probability distributions that are independent of time, such as eigenstates of the Hamiltonian.: 133–137  Many systems that are treated dynamically in classical mechanics are described by such ""static"" wave functions",Quantum Mechanics
"For example, a single electron in an unexcited atom is pictured classically as a particle moving in a circular trajectory around the atomic nucleus, whereas in quantum mechanics, it is described by a static wave function surrounding the nucleus",Quantum Mechanics
"For example, the electron wave function for an unexcited hydrogen atom is a spherically symmetric function known as an s orbital (Fig",Quantum Mechanics
"1).
Analytic solutions of the Schrödinger equation are known for very few relatively simple model Hamiltonians including the quantum harmonic oscillator, the particle in a box, the dihydrogen cation, and the hydrogen atom",Quantum Mechanics
"Even the helium atom – which contains just two electrons – has defied all attempts at a fully analytic treatment, admitting no solution in closed form.
However, there are techniques for finding approximate solutions",Quantum Mechanics
"One method, called perturbation theory, uses the analytic result for a simple quantum mechanical model to create a result for a related but more complicated model by (for example) the addition of a weak potential energy.: 793  Another approximation method applies to systems for which quantum mechanics produces only small deviations from classical behavior",Quantum Mechanics
"These deviations can then be computed based on the classical motion.: 849 


=== Uncertainty principle ===
One consequence of the basic quantum formalism is the uncertainty principle",Quantum Mechanics
"In its most familiar form, this states that no preparation of a quantum particle can imply simultaneously precise predictions both for a measurement of its position and for a measurement of its momentum",Quantum Mechanics
"Both position and momentum are observables, meaning that they are represented by Hermitian operators",Quantum Mechanics
"The position operator

              X

        .
      
    
    {\displaystyle [{\hat {X}},{\hat {P}}]=i\hbar .}

Another consequence of the canonical commutation relation is that the position and momentum operators are Fourier transforms of each other, so that a description of an object according to its momentum is the Fourier transform of its description according to its position",Quantum Mechanics
"The fact that dependence in momentum is the Fourier transform of the dependence in position means that the momentum operator is equivalent (up to an

          p
          
            i

is a valid joint state that is not separable",Quantum Mechanics
"States that are not separable are called entangled.
If the state for a composite system is entangled, it is impossible to describe either component system A or system B by a state vector",Quantum Mechanics
One can instead define reduced density matrices that describe the statistics that can be obtained by making measurements on either component system alone,Quantum Mechanics
"This necessarily causes a loss of information, though: knowing the reduced density matrices of the individual systems is not enough to reconstruct the state of the composite system",Quantum Mechanics
"Just as density matrices specify the state of a subsystem of a larger system, analogously, positive operator-valued measures (POVMs) describe the effect on a subsystem of a measurement performed on a larger system",Quantum Mechanics
"POVMs are extensively used in quantum information theory.
As described above, entanglement is a key feature of models of measurement processes in which an apparatus becomes entangled with the system being measured",Quantum Mechanics
"Systems interacting with the environment in which they reside generally become entangled with that environment, a phenomenon known as quantum decoherence",Quantum Mechanics
"This can explain why, in practice, quantum effects are difficult to observe in systems larger than microscopic.


=== Equivalence between formulations ===
There are many mathematically equivalent formulations of quantum mechanics",Quantum Mechanics
"One of the oldest and most common is the ""transformation theory"" proposed by Paul Dirac, which unifies and generalizes the two earliest formulations of quantum mechanics – matrix mechanics (invented by Werner Heisenberg) and wave mechanics (invented by Erwin Schrödinger)",Quantum Mechanics
"An alternative formulation of quantum mechanics is Feynman's path integral formulation, in which a quantum-mechanical amplitude is considered as a sum over all possible classical and non-classical paths between the initial and final states",Quantum Mechanics
"This is the quantum-mechanical counterpart of the action principle in classical mechanics.

We see that as we make 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  
 smaller the spread in position gets smaller, but the spread in momentum gets larger",Quantum Mechanics
"Conversely, by making 
  
    
      
        a
      
    
    {\displaystyle a}
  
 larger we make the spread in momentum smaller, but the spread in position gets larger",Quantum Mechanics
"This illustrates the uncertainty principle.
As we let the Gaussian wave packet evolve in time, we see that its center moves through space at a constant velocity (like a classical particle with no forces acting on it)",Quantum Mechanics
"However, the wave packet will also spread out as time progresses, which means that the position becomes more and more uncertain",Quantum Mechanics
"The uncertainty in momentum, however, stays constant.

A finite potential well is the generalization of the infinite potential well problem to potential wells having finite depth",Quantum Mechanics
The finite potential well problem is mathematically more complicated than the infinite particle-in-a-box problem as the wave function is not pinned to zero at the walls of the well,Quantum Mechanics
"Instead, the wave function must satisfy more complicated mathematical boundary conditions as it is nonzero in regions outside the well",Quantum Mechanics
"Another related problem is that of the rectangular potential barrier, which furnishes a model for the quantum tunneling effect that plays an important role in the performance of modern technologies such as flash memory and scanning tunneling microscopy.

=== Mach–Zehnder interferometer ===

The Mach–Zehnder interferometer (MZI) illustrates the concepts of superposition and interference with linear algebra in dimension 2, rather than differential equations",Quantum Mechanics
"It can be seen as a simplified version of the double-slit experiment, but it is of interest in its own right, for example in the delayed choice quantum eraser, the Elitzur–Vaidman bomb tester, and in studies of quantum entanglement.
We can model a photon going through the interferometer by considering that at each point it can be in a superposition of only two paths: the ""lower"" path which starts from the left, goes straight through both beam splitters, and ends at the top, and the ""upper"" path which starts from the bottom, goes straight through both beam splitters, and ends at the right",Quantum Mechanics

One can therefore use the Mach–Zehnder interferometer to estimate the phase shift by estimating these probabilities.
It is interesting to consider what would happen if the photon were definitely in either the ""lower"" or ""upper"" paths between the beam splitters",Quantum Mechanics
"This can be accomplished by blocking one of the paths, or equivalently by removing the first beam splitter (and feeding the photon from the left or the bottom, as desired)",Quantum Mechanics
"In both cases, there will be no interference between the paths anymore, and the probabilities are given by 
  
    
      
        p
        (
        u

"From this we can conclude that the photon does not take one path or another after the first beam splitter, but rather that it is in a genuine quantum superposition of the two paths.


== Applications ==

Quantum mechanics has had enormous success in explaining many of the features of our universe, with regard to small-scale and discrete quantities and interactions which cannot be explained by classical methods",Quantum Mechanics
"Quantum mechanics is often the only theory that can reveal the individual behaviors of the subatomic particles that make up all forms of matter (electrons, protons, neutrons, photons, and others)",Quantum Mechanics
"Solid-state physics and materials science are dependent upon quantum mechanics.
In many aspects, modern technology operates at a scale where quantum effects are significant",Quantum Mechanics
"Important applications of quantum theory include quantum chemistry, quantum optics, quantum computing, superconducting magnets, light-emitting diodes, the optical amplifier and the laser, the transistor and semiconductors such as the microprocessor, medical and research imaging such as magnetic resonance imaging and electron microscopy",Quantum Mechanics
"Explanations for many biological and physical phenomena are rooted in the nature of the chemical bond, most notably the macro-molecule DNA.


== Relation to other scientific theories ==


=== Classical mechanics ===
The rules of quantum mechanics assert that the state space of a system is a Hilbert space and that observables of the system are Hermitian operators acting on vectors in that space – although they do not tell us which Hilbert space or which operators",Quantum Mechanics
"These can be chosen appropriately in order to obtain a quantitative description of a quantum system, a necessary step in making physical predictions",Quantum Mechanics
"An important guide for making these choices is the correspondence principle, a heuristic which states that the predictions of quantum mechanics reduce to those of classical mechanics in the regime of large quantum numbers",Quantum Mechanics
"One can also start from an established classical model of a particular system, and then try to guess the underlying quantum model that would give rise to the classical model in the correspondence limit",Quantum Mechanics
"This approach is known as quantization.: 299 
When quantum mechanics was originally formulated, it was applied to models whose correspondence limit was non-relativistic classical mechanics",Quantum Mechanics
"For instance, the well-known model of the quantum harmonic oscillator uses an explicitly non-relativistic expression for the kinetic energy of the oscillator, and is thus a quantum version of the classical harmonic oscillator.: 234 
Complications arise with chaotic systems, which do not have good quantum numbers, and quantum chaos studies the relationship between classical and quantum descriptions in these systems.: 353 
Quantum decoherence is a mechanism through which quantum systems lose coherence, and thus become incapable of displaying many typically quantum effects: quantum superpositions become simply probabilistic mixtures, and quantum entanglement becomes simply classical correlations.: 687–730  Quantum coherence is not typically evident at macroscopic scales, though at temperatures approaching absolute zero quantum behavior may manifest macroscopically.
Many macroscopic properties of a classical system are a direct consequence of the quantum behavior of its parts",Quantum Mechanics
"For example, the stability of bulk matter (consisting of atoms and molecules which would quickly collapse under electric forces alone), the rigidity of solids, and the mechanical, thermal, chemical, optical and magnetic properties of matter are all results of the interaction of electric charges under the rules of quantum mechanics.


=== Special relativity and electrodynamics ===
Early attempts to merge quantum mechanics with special relativity involved the replacement of the Schrödinger equation with a covariant equation such as the Klein–Gordon equation or the Dirac equation",Quantum Mechanics
"While these theories were successful in explaining many experimental results, they had certain unsatisfactory qualities stemming from their neglect of the relativistic creation and annihilation of particles",Quantum Mechanics
"A fully relativistic quantum theory required the development of quantum field theory, which applies quantization to a field (rather than a fixed set of particles)",Quantum Mechanics
"The first complete quantum field theory, quantum electrodynamics, provides a fully quantum description of the electromagnetic interaction",Quantum Mechanics
"Quantum electrodynamics is, along with general relativity, one of the most accurate physical theories ever devised.
The full apparatus of quantum field theory is often unnecessary for describing electrodynamic systems",Quantum Mechanics
"A simpler approach, one that has been used since the inception of quantum mechanics, is to treat charged particles as quantum mechanical objects being acted on by a classical electromagnetic field",Quantum Mechanics
"For example, the elementary quantum model of the hydrogen atom describes the electric field of the hydrogen atom using a classical

 Coulomb potential.: 285  Likewise, in a Stern–Gerlach experiment, a charged particle is modeled as a quantum system, while the background magnetic field is described classically.: 26  This ""semi-classical"" approach fails if quantum fluctuations in the electromagnetic field play an important role, such as in the emission of photons by charged particles.
Quantum field theories for the strong nuclear force and the weak nuclear force have also been developed",Quantum Mechanics
"The quantum field theory of the strong nuclear force is called quantum chromodynamics, and describes the interactions of subnuclear particles such as quarks and gluons",Quantum Mechanics
"The weak nuclear force and the electromagnetic force were unified, in their quantized forms, into a single quantum field theory (known as electroweak theory), by the physicists Abdus Salam, Sheldon Glashow and Steven Weinberg.


=== Relation to general relativity ===
Even though the predictions of both quantum theory and general relativity have been supported by rigorous and repeated empirical evidence, their abstract formalisms contradict each other and they have proven extremely difficult to incorporate into one consistent, cohesive model",Quantum Mechanics
"Gravity is negligible in many areas of particle physics, so that unification between general relativity and quantum mechanics is not an urgent issue in those particular applications",Quantum Mechanics
"However, the lack of a correct theory of quantum gravity is an important issue in physical cosmology and the search by physicists for an elegant ""Theory of Everything"" (TOE)",Quantum Mechanics
"Consequently, resolving the inconsistencies between both theories has been a major goal of 20th- and 21st-century physics",Quantum Mechanics
"This TOE would combine not only the models of subatomic physics but also derive the four fundamental forces of nature from a single force or phenomenon.

One proposal for doing so is string theory, which posits that the point-like particles of particle physics are replaced by one-dimensional objects called strings",Quantum Mechanics
String theory describes how these strings propagate through space and interact with each other,Quantum Mechanics
"On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string looks just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string",Quantum Mechanics
"In string theory, one of the many vibrational states of the string corresponds to the graviton, a quantum mechanical particle that carries gravitational force.
Another popular theory is loop quantum gravity (LQG), which describes quantum properties of gravity and is thus a theory of quantum spacetime",Quantum Mechanics
LQG is an attempt to merge and adapt standard quantum mechanics and standard general relativity,Quantum Mechanics
"This theory describes space as an extremely fine fabric ""woven"" of finite loops called spin networks",Quantum Mechanics
The evolution of a spin network over time is called a spin foam,Quantum Mechanics
"The characteristic length scale of a spin foam is the Planck length, approximately 1.616×10−35 m, and so lengths shorter than the Planck length are not physically meaningful in LQG.


== Philosophical implications ==

Since its inception, the many counter-intuitive aspects and results of quantum mechanics have provoked strong philosophical debates and many interpretations",Quantum Mechanics
"The arguments centre on the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics, the difficulties with wavefunction collapse and the related measurement problem, and quantum nonlocality",Quantum Mechanics
Perhaps the only consensus that exists about these issues is that there is no consensus,Quantum Mechanics
"Richard Feynman once said, ""I think I can safely say that nobody understands quantum mechanics."" According to Steven Weinberg, ""There is now in my opinion no entirely satisfactory interpretation of quantum mechanics.""
The views of Niels Bohr, Werner Heisenberg and other physicists are often grouped together as the ""Copenhagen interpretation""",Quantum Mechanics
"According to these views, the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics is not a temporary feature which will eventually be replaced by a deterministic theory, but is instead a final renunciation of the classical idea of ""causality""",Quantum Mechanics
"Bohr in particular emphasized that any well-defined application of the quantum mechanical formalism must always make reference to the experimental arrangement, due to the complementary nature of evidence obtained under different experimental situations",Quantum Mechanics
"Copenhagen-type interpretations were adopted by Nobel laureates in quantum physics, including Bohr, Heisenberg, Schrödinger, Feynman, and Zeilinger as well as 21st-century researchers in quantum foundations.
Albert Einstein, himself one of the founders of quantum theory, was troubled by its apparent failure to respect some cherished metaphysical principles, such as determinism and locality",Quantum Mechanics
Einstein's long-running exchanges with Bohr about the meaning and status of quantum mechanics are now known as the Bohr–Einstein debates,Quantum Mechanics
Einstein believed that underlying quantum mechanics must be a theory that explicitly forbids action at a distance,Quantum Mechanics
"He argued that quantum mechanics was incomplete, a theory that was valid but not fundamental, analogous to how thermodynamics is valid, but the fundamental theory behind it is statistical mechanics",Quantum Mechanics
"In 1935, Einstein and his collaborators Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen published an argument that the principle of locality implies the incompleteness of quantum mechanics, a thought experiment later termed the Einstein–Podolsky–Rosen paradox",Quantum Mechanics
"In 1964, John Bell showed that EPR's principle of locality, together with determinism, was actually incompatible with quantum mechanics: they implied constraints on the correlations produced by distance systems, now known as Bell inequalities, that can be violated by entangled particles",Quantum Mechanics
"Since then several experiments have been performed to obtain these correlations, with the result that they do in fact violate Bell inequalities, and thus falsify the conjunction of locality with determinism.
Bohmian mechanics shows that it is possible to reformulate quantum mechanics to make it deterministic, at the price of making it explicitly nonlocal",Quantum Mechanics
"It attributes not only a wave function to a physical system, but in addition a real position, that evolves deterministically under a nonlocal guiding equation",Quantum Mechanics
The evolution of a physical system is given at all times by the Schrödinger equation together with the guiding equation; there is never a collapse of the wave function,Quantum Mechanics
"This solves the measurement problem.

Everett's many-worlds interpretation, formulated in 1956, holds that all the possibilities described by quantum theory simultaneously occur in a multiverse composed of mostly independent parallel universes",Quantum Mechanics
This is a consequence of removing the axiom of the collapse of the wave packet,Quantum Mechanics
"All possible states of the measured system and the measuring apparatus, together with the observer, are present in a real physical quantum superposition",Quantum Mechanics
"While the multiverse is deterministic, we perceive non-deterministic behavior governed by probabilities, because we do not observe the multiverse as a whole, but only one parallel universe at a time",Quantum Mechanics
Exactly how this is supposed to work has been the subject of much debate,Quantum Mechanics
"Several attempts have been made to make sense of this and derive the Born rule, with no consensus on whether they have been successful.
Relational quantum mechanics appeared in the late 1990s as a modern derivative of Copenhagen-type ideas, and QBism was developed some years later.


== History ==

Quantum mechanics was developed in the early decades of the 20th century, driven by the need to explain phenomena that, in some cases, had been observed in earlier times",Quantum Mechanics
"Scientific inquiry into the wave nature of light began in the 17th and 18th centuries, when scientists such as Robert Hooke, Christiaan Huygens and Leonhard Euler proposed a wave theory of light based on experimental observations",Quantum Mechanics
In 1803 English polymath Thomas Young described the famous double-slit experiment,Quantum Mechanics
"This experiment played a major role in the general acceptance of the wave theory of light.
During the early 19th century, chemical research by John Dalton and Amedeo Avogadro lent weight to the atomic theory of matter, an idea that James Clerk Maxwell, Ludwig Boltzmann and others built upon to establish the kinetic theory of gases",Quantum Mechanics
"The successes of kinetic theory gave further credence to the idea that matter is composed of atoms, yet the theory also had shortcomings that would only be resolved by the development of quantum mechanics",Quantum Mechanics
"While the early conception of atoms from Greek philosophy had been that they were indivisible units – the word ""atom"" deriving from the Greek for ""uncuttable"" –  the 19th century saw the formulation of hypotheses about subatomic structure",Quantum Mechanics
One important discovery in that regard was Michael Faraday's 1838 observation of a glow caused by an electrical discharge inside a glass tube containing gas at low pressure,Quantum Mechanics
"Julius Plücker, Johann Wilhelm Hittorf and Eugen Goldstein carried on and improved upon Faraday's work, leading to the identification of cathode rays, which J",Quantum Mechanics
"Thomson found to consist of subatomic particles that would be called electrons.

The black-body radiation problem was discovered by Gustav Kirchhoff in 1859",Quantum Mechanics
"In 1900, Max Planck proposed the hypothesis that energy is radiated and absorbed in discrete ""quanta"" (or energy packets), yielding a calculation that precisely matched the observed patterns of black-body radiation",Quantum Mechanics
"The word quantum derives from the Latin, meaning ""how great"" or ""how much""",Quantum Mechanics
"According to Planck, quantities of energy could be thought of as divided into ""elements"" whose size (E) would be proportional to their frequency (ν):

  
    
      
        E
        =
        h
        ν
         
      
    
    {\displaystyle E=h\nu \ }
  
,
where h is the Planck constant",Quantum Mechanics
Planck cautiously insisted that this was only an aspect of the processes of absorption and emission of radiation and was not the physical reality of the radiation,Quantum Mechanics
"In fact, he considered his quantum hypothesis a mathematical trick to get the right answer rather than a sizable discovery",Quantum Mechanics
"However, in 1905 Albert Einstein interpreted Planck's quantum hypothesis realistically and used it to explain the photoelectric effect, in which shining light on certain materials can eject electrons from the material",Quantum Mechanics
Niels Bohr then developed Planck's ideas about radiation into a model of the hydrogen atom that successfully predicted the spectral lines of hydrogen,Quantum Mechanics
"Einstein further developed this idea to show that an electromagnetic wave such as light could also be described as a particle (later called the photon), with a discrete amount of energy that depends on its frequency",Quantum Mechanics
"In his paper ""On the Quantum Theory of Radiation"", Einstein expanded on the interaction between energy and matter to explain the absorption and emission of energy by atoms",Quantum Mechanics
"Although overshadowed at the time by his general theory of relativity, this paper articulated the mechanism underlying the stimulated emission of radiation, which became the basis of the laser.

This phase is known as the old quantum theory",Quantum Mechanics
"Never complete or self-consistent, the old quantum theory was rather a set of heuristic corrections to classical mechanics",Quantum Mechanics
The theory is now understood as a semi-classical approximation to modern quantum mechanics,Quantum Mechanics
"Notable results from this period include, in addition to the work of Planck, Einstein and Bohr mentioned above, Einstein and Peter Debye's work on the specific heat of solids, Bohr and Hendrika Johanna van Leeuwen's proof that classical physics cannot account for diamagnetism, and Arnold Sommerfeld's extension of the Bohr model to include special-relativistic effects.
In the mid-1920s quantum mechanics was developed to become the standard formulation for atomic physics",Quantum Mechanics
"In 1923, the French physicist Louis de Broglie put forward his theory of matter waves by stating that particles can exhibit wave characteristics and vice versa",Quantum Mechanics
"Building on de Broglie's approach, modern quantum mechanics was born in 1925, when the German physicists Werner Heisenberg, Max Born, and Pascual Jordan developed matrix mechanics and the Austrian physicist Erwin Schrödinger invented wave mechanics",Quantum Mechanics
Born introduced the probabilistic interpretation of Schrödinger's wave function in July 1926,Quantum Mechanics
"Thus, the entire field of quantum physics emerged, leading to its wider acceptance at the Fifth Solvay Conference in 1927.
By 1930, quantum mechanics had been further unified and formalized by David Hilbert, Paul Dirac and John von Neumann with greater emphasis on measurement, the statistical nature of our knowledge of reality, and philosophical speculation about the 'observer'",Quantum Mechanics
"It has since permeated many disciplines, including quantum chemistry, quantum electronics, quantum optics, and quantum information science",Quantum Mechanics
"It also provides a useful framework for many features of the modern periodic table of elements, and describes the behaviors of atoms during chemical bonding and the flow of electrons in computer semiconductors, and therefore plays a crucial role in many modern technologies",Quantum Mechanics
"While quantum mechanics was constructed to describe the world of the very small, it is also needed to explain some macroscopic phenomena such as superconductors and superfluids.

CRISPR () (an acronym for clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) is a family of DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotic organisms such as bacteria and archaea,CRISPR
These sequences are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the prokaryote,CRISPR
They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections,CRISPR
Hence these sequences play a key role in the antiviral (i.e,CRISPR
anti-phage) defense system of prokaryotes and provide a form of acquired immunity,CRISPR
"CRISPR is found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea.

Cas9 (or ""CRISPR-associated protein 9"") is an enzyme that uses CRISPR sequences as a guide to recognize and open up specific strands of DNA that are complementary to the CRISPR sequence",CRISPR
Cas9 enzymes together with CRISPR sequences form the basis of a technology known as CRISPR-Cas9 that can be used to edit genes within living organisms,CRISPR
"This editing process has a wide variety of applications including basic biological research, development of biotechnological products, and treatment of diseases",CRISPR
"The development of the CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing technique was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020 awarded to Emmanuelle Charpentier and Jennifer Doudna.


== History ==


=== Repeated sequences ===
The discovery of clustered DNA repeats took place independently in three parts of the world",CRISPR
The first description of what would later be called CRISPR is from Osaka University researcher Yoshizumi Ishino and his colleagues in 1987,CRISPR
"They accidentally cloned part of a CRISPR sequence together with the ""iap"" gene (isozyme conversion of alkaline phosphatase) from the genome of Escherichia coli which was their target",CRISPR
"Repeated sequences are typically arranged consecutively, without interspersing different sequences",CRISPR
"They did not know the function of the interrupted clustered repeats.
In 1993, researchers of Mycobacterium tuberculosis in the Netherlands published two articles about a cluster of interrupted direct repeats (DR) in that bacterium",CRISPR
They recognized the diversity of the sequences that intervened in the direct repeats among different strains of M,CRISPR
"tuberculosis and used this property to design a typing method called spoligotyping, still in use today.
Francisco Mojica at the University of Alicante in Spain studied the function of repeats in the archaeal species Haloferax and Haloarcula",CRISPR
"Mojica's supervisor surmised that the clustered repeats had a role in correctly segregating replicated DNA into daughter cells during cell division, because plasmids and chromosomes with identical repeat arrays could not coexist in Haloferax volcanii",CRISPR
Transcription of the interrupted repeats was also noted for the first time; this was the first full characterization of CRISPR,CRISPR
"By 2000, Mojica and his students, after an automated search of published genomes, identified interrupted repeats in 20 species of microbes as belonging to the same family",CRISPR
"Because those sequences were interspaced, Mojica initially called these sequences ""short regularly spaced repeats"" (SRSR)",CRISPR
"In 2001, Mojica and Ruud Jansen, who were searching for an additional interrupted repeats, proposed the acronym CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) to unify the numerous acronyms used to describe these sequences",CRISPR
"showed evidence that CRISPR repeat regions from the genome of Archaeoglobus fulgidus were transcribed into long RNA molecules subsequently processed into unit-length small RNAs, plus some longer forms of 2, 3, or more spacer-repeat units.
In 2005, yogurt researcher Rodolphe Barrangou discovered that Streptococcus thermophilus, after iterative phage infection challenges, develops increased phage resistance due to the incorporation of additional CRISPR spacer sequences",CRISPR
"Barrangou's employer, the Danish food company Danisco, then developed phage-resistant S",CRISPR
"Danisco was later bought by DuPont, which owns about 50 percent of the global dairy culture market, and the technology spread widely.


=== CRISPR-associated systems ===
A major advance in understanding CRISPR came with Jansen's observation that the prokaryote repeat cluster was accompanied by four homologous genes that make up CRISPR-associated systems, cas 1–4",CRISPR
"The Cas proteins showed helicase and nuclease motifs, suggesting a role in the dynamic structure of the CRISPR loci",CRISPR
"In this publication, the acronym CRISPR was used as the universal name of this pattern, but its function remained enigmatic.

In 2005, three independent research groups showed that some CRISPR spacers are derived from phage DNA and extrachromosomal DNA such as plasmids",CRISPR
"In effect, the spacers are fragments of DNA gathered from viruses that previously attacked the cell",CRISPR
The source of the spacers was a sign that the CRISPR-cas system could have a role in adaptive immunity in bacteria,CRISPR
"All three studies proposing this idea were initially rejected by high-profile journals, but eventually appeared in other journals.
The first publication proposing a role of CRISPR-Cas in microbial immunity, by Mojica and collaborators at the University of Alicante, predicted a role for the RNA transcript of spacers on target recognition in a mechanism that could be analogous to the RNA interference system used by eukaryotic cells",CRISPR
"Koonin and colleagues extended this RNA interference hypothesis by proposing mechanisms of action for the different CRISPR-Cas subtypes according to the predicted function of their proteins.
Experimental work by several groups revealed the basic mechanisms of CRISPR-Cas immunity",CRISPR
"In 2007, the first experimental evidence that CRISPR was an adaptive immune system was published",CRISPR
A CRISPR region in Streptococcus thermophilus acquired spacers from the DNA of an infecting bacteriophage,CRISPR
thermophilus to different types of phages by adding and deleting spacers whose sequence matched those found in the tested phages,CRISPR
"In 2008, Brouns and Van der Oost identified a complex of Cas proteins called Cascade, that in E",CRISPR
"coli cut the CRISPR RNA precursor within the repeats into mature spacer-containing RNA molecules called CRISPR RNA (crRNA), which remained bound to the protein complex",CRISPR
"Moreover, it was found that Cascade, crRNA and a helicase/nuclease (Cas3) were required to provide a bacterial host with immunity against infection by a DNA virus",CRISPR
"By designing an anti-virus CRISPR, they demonstrated that two orientations of the crRNA (sense/antisense) provided immunity, indicating that the crRNA guides were targeting dsDNA",CRISPR
That year Marraffini and Sontheimer confirmed that a CRISPR sequence of S,CRISPR
"This finding was at odds with the proposed RNA-interference-like mechanism of CRISPR-Cas immunity, although a CRISPR-Cas system that targets foreign RNA was later found in Pyrococcus furiosus",CRISPR
A 2010 study showed that CRISPR-Cas cuts strands of both phage and plasmid DNA in S,CRISPR
"thermophilus.


=== Cas9 ===

A simpler CRISPR system from Streptococcus pyogenes relies on the protein Cas9",CRISPR
The Cas9 endonuclease is a four-component system that includes two small molecules: crRNA and trans-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA),CRISPR
"In 2012, Jennifer Doudna and Emmanuelle Charpentier re-engineered the Cas9 endonuclease into a more manageable two-component system by fusing the two RNA molecules into a ""single-guide RNA"" that, when combined with Cas9, could find and cut the DNA target specified by the guide RNA",CRISPR
This contribution was so significant that it was recognized by the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2020,CRISPR
"By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, the artificial Cas9 system could be programmed to target any DNA sequence for separation",CRISPR
"Another collaboration comprising Virginijus Šikšnys, Gasiūnas, Barrangou, and Horvath showed that Cas9 from the S",CRISPR
thermophilus CRISPR system can also be reprogrammed to target a site of their choosing by changing the sequence of its crRNA,CRISPR
"These advances fueled efforts to edit genomes with the modified CRISPR-Cas9 system.
Groups led by Feng Zhang and George Church simultaneously published descriptions of genome editing in human cell cultures using CRISPR-Cas9 for the first time",CRISPR
"It has since been used in a wide range of organisms, including baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the opportunistic pathogen Candida albicans, zebrafish (Danio rerio), fruit flies (Drosophila melanogaster), ants (Harpegnathos saltator and Ooceraea biroi), mosquitoes (Aedes aegypti), nematodes (Caenorhabditis elegans), plants, mice (Mus musculus domesticus), monkeys and human embryos.
CRISPR has been modified to make programmable transcription factors that allows activation or silencing of targeted genes.

The CRISPR-Cas9 system has been shown to make effective gene edits in Human tripronuclear zygotes, as first described in a 2015 paper by Chinese scientists P",CRISPR
The system made a successful cleavage of mutant Beta-Hemoglobin (HBB) in 28 out of 54 embryos,CRISPR
Four out of the 28 embryos were successfully recombined using a donor template,CRISPR
"The scientists showed that during DNA recombination of the cleaved strand, the homologous endogenous sequence HBD competes with the exogenous donor template",CRISPR
"DNA repair in human embryos is much more complicated and particular than in derived stem cells.


=== Cas12a ===

In 2015, the nuclease Cas12a (formerly called Cpf1) was characterized in the CRISPR-Cpf1 system of the bacterium Francisella novicida",CRISPR
"Its original name, from a TIGRFAMs protein family definition built in 2012, reflects the prevalence of its CRISPR-Cas subtype in the Prevotella and Francisella lineages",CRISPR
"Cas12a showed several key differences from Cas9 including: causing a 'staggered' cut in double stranded DNA as opposed to the 'blunt' cut produced by Cas9, relying on a 'T rich' PAM (providing alternative targeting sites to Cas9), and requiring only a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) for successful targeting",CRISPR
"By contrast, Cas9 requires both crRNA and a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA).
These differences may give Cas12a some advantages over Cas9",CRISPR
"For example, Cas12a's small crRNAs are ideal for multiplexed genome editing, as more of them can be packaged in one vector than can Cas9's sgRNAs",CRISPR
The sticky 5′ overhangs left by Cas12a can also be used for DNA assembly that is much more target-specific than traditional restriction enzyme cloning,CRISPR
"Finally, Cas12a cleaves DNA 18–23 base pairs downstream from the PAM site",CRISPR
"This means there is no disruption to the recognition sequence after repair, and so Cas12a enables multiple rounds of DNA cleavage",CRISPR
"By contrast, since Cas9 cuts only 3 base pairs upstream of the PAM site, the NHEJ pathway results in indel mutations that destroy the recognition sequence, thereby preventing further rounds of cutting",CRISPR
"In theory, repeated rounds of DNA cleavage should cause an increased opportunity for the desired genomic editing to occur",CRISPR
"A distinctive feature of Cas12a, as compared to Cas9, is that after cutting its target, Cas12a remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssDNA molecules non-discriminately",CRISPR
"This property is called ""collateral cleavage"" or ""trans-cleavage"" activity and has been exploited for the development of various diagnostic technologies.


=== Cas13 ===
In 2016, the nuclease Cas13a (formerly known as C2c2) from the bacterium Leptotrichia shahii was characterized",CRISPR
"Cas13 is an RNA-guided RNA endonuclease, which means that it does not cleave DNA, but only single-stranded RNA",CRISPR
Cas13 is guided by its crRNA to a ssRNA target and binds and cleaves the target,CRISPR
"Similar to Cas12a, the Cas13 remains bound to the target and then cleaves other ssRNA molecules non-discriminately",CRISPR
"This collateral cleavage property has been exploited for the development of various diagnostic technologies.
In 2021, Dr",CRISPR
"Hui Yang characterized novel miniature Cas13 protein (mCas13) variants, Cas13X and Cas13Y",CRISPR
"Using a small portion of N gene sequence from SARS-CoV-2 as a target in characterization of mCas13, revealed the sensitivity and specificity of mCas13 coupled with RT-LAMP for detection of SARS-CoV-2 in both synthetic and clinical samples over other available standard tests like RT-qPCR (1 copy/μL).


== Locus structure ==


=== Repeats and spacers ===
The CRISPR array is made up of an AT-rich leader sequence followed by short repeats that are separated by unique spacers",CRISPR
"CRISPR repeats typically range in size from 28 to 37 base pairs (bps), though there can be as few as 23 bp and as many as 55 bp",CRISPR
"Some show dyad symmetry, implying the formation of a secondary structure such as a stem-loop ('hairpin') in the RNA, while others are designed to be unstructured",CRISPR
The size of spacers in different CRISPR arrays is typically 32 to 38 bp (range 21 to 72 bp),CRISPR
New spacers can appear rapidly as part of the immune response to phage infection,CRISPR
"There are usually fewer than 50 units of the repeat-spacer sequence in a CRISPR array.

=== Cas genes and CRISPR subtypes ===
Small clusters of cas genes are often located next to CRISPR repeat-spacer arrays",CRISPR
Collectively the 93 cas genes are grouped into 35 families based on sequence similarity of the encoded proteins,CRISPR
"11 of the 35 families form the cas core, which includes the protein families Cas1 through Cas9",CRISPR
"A complete CRISPR-Cas locus has at least one gene belonging to the cas core.
CRISPR-Cas systems fall into two classes",CRISPR
Class 1 systems use a complex of multiple Cas proteins to degrade foreign nucleic acids,CRISPR
Class 2 systems use a single large Cas protein for the same purpose,CRISPR
"Class 1 is divided into types I, III, and IV; class 2 is divided into types II, V, and VI",CRISPR
"Each type and most subtypes are characterized by a ""signature gene"" found almost exclusively in the category",CRISPR
Classification is also based on the complement of cas genes that are present,CRISPR
"The phylogeny of Cas1 proteins generally agrees with the classification system, but exceptions exist due to module shuffling",CRISPR
Many organisms contain multiple CRISPR-Cas systems suggesting that they are compatible and may share components,CRISPR
"The sporadic distribution of the CRISPR-Cas subtypes suggests that the CRISPR-Cas system is subject to horizontal gene transfer during microbial evolution.


== Mechanism ==

CRISPR-Cas immunity is a natural process of bacteria and archaea",CRISPR
"CRISPR-Cas prevents bacteriophage infection, conjugation and natural transformation by degrading foreign nucleic acids that enter the cell.


=== Spacer acquisition ===
When a microbe is invaded by a bacteriophage, the first stage of the immune response is to capture phage DNA and insert it into a CRISPR locus in the form of a spacer",CRISPR
"Cas1 and Cas2 are found in both types of CRISPR-Cas immune systems, which indicates that they are involved in spacer acquisition",CRISPR
"Mutation studies confirmed this hypothesis, showing that removal of Cas1 or Cas2 stopped spacer acquisition, without affecting CRISPR immune response.
Multiple Cas1 proteins have been characterised and their structures resolved",CRISPR
"However, their crystal structures are similar and all purified Cas1 proteins are metal-dependent nucleases/integrases that bind to DNA in a sequence-independent manner",CRISPR
"Representative Cas2 proteins have been characterised and possess either (single strand) ssRNA- or (double strand) dsDNA- specific endoribonuclease activity.
In the I-E system of E",CRISPR
coli Cas1 and Cas2 form a complex where a Cas2 dimer bridges two Cas1 dimers,CRISPR
"In this complex Cas2 performs a non-enzymatic scaffolding role, binding double-stranded fragments of invading DNA, while Cas1 binds the single-stranded flanks of the DNA and catalyses their integration into CRISPR arrays",CRISPR
New spacers are usually added at the beginning of the CRISPR next to the leader sequence creating a chronological record of viral infections,CRISPR
"coli a histone like protein called integration host factor (IHF), which binds to the leader sequence, is responsible for the accuracy of this integration",CRISPR
IHF also enhances integration efficiency in the type I-F system of Pectobacterium atrosepticum,CRISPR
"but in other systems, different host factors may be required


==== Protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM) ====

Bioinformatic analysis of regions of phage genomes that were excised as spacers (termed protospacers) revealed that they were not randomly selected but instead were found adjacent to short (3–5 bp) DNA sequences termed protospacer adjacent motifs (PAM)",CRISPR
"Analysis of CRISPR-Cas systems showed PAMs to be important for type I and type II, but not type III systems during acquisition",CRISPR
"In type I and type II systems, protospacers are excised at positions adjacent to a PAM sequence, with the other end of the spacer cut using a ruler mechanism, thus maintaining the regularity of the spacer size in the CRISPR array",CRISPR
"The conservation of the PAM sequence differs between CRISPR-Cas systems and appears to be evolutionarily linked to Cas1 and the leader sequence.
New spacers are added to a CRISPR array in a directional manner, occurring preferentially, but not exclusively, adjacent to the leader sequence",CRISPR
"coli demonstrated that the first direct repeat adjacent to the leader sequence is copied, with the newly acquired spacer inserted between the first and second direct repeats.
The PAM sequence appears to be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems",CRISPR
That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer,CRISPR
This nt becomes the final base in the first direct repeat,CRISPR
This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the direct repeat and in the PAM during spacer insertion,CRISPR
"However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show the same level of conservation in the final position",CRISPR
"It is likely that in those systems, a blunt end is generated at the very end of the direct repeat and the protospacer during acquisition.


==== Insertion variants ====
Analysis of Sulfolobus solfataricus CRISPRs revealed further complexities to the canonical model of spacer insertion, as one of its six CRISPR loci inserted new spacers randomly throughout its CRISPR array, as opposed to inserting closest to the leader sequence.
Multiple CRISPRs contain many spacers to the same phage",CRISPR
The mechanism that causes this phenomenon was discovered in the type I-E system of E,CRISPR
"A significant enhancement in spacer acquisition was detected where spacers already target the phage, even mismatches to the protospacer",CRISPR
This 'priming' requires the Cas proteins involved in both acquisition and interference to interact with each other,CRISPR
Newly acquired spacers that result from the priming mechanism are always found on the same strand as the priming spacer,CRISPR
"This observation led to the hypothesis that the acquisition machinery slides along the foreign DNA after priming to find a new protospacer.


=== Biogenesis ===
CRISPR-RNA (crRNA), which later guides the Cas nuclease to the target during the interference step, must be generated from the CRISPR sequence",CRISPR
The crRNA is initially transcribed as part of a single long transcript encompassing much of the CRISPR array,CRISPR
This transcript is then cleaved by Cas proteins to form crRNAs,CRISPR
"In type I-E and type I-F systems, the proteins Cas6e and Cas6f respectively, recognise stem-loops created by the pairing of identical repeats that flank the crRNA",CRISPR
"These Cas proteins cleave the longer transcript at the edge of the paired region, leaving a single crRNA along with a small remnant of the paired repeat region.
Type III systems also use Cas6, however, their repeats do not produce stem-loops",CRISPR
"Cleavage instead occurs by the longer transcript wrapping around the Cas6 to allow cleavage just upstream of the repeat sequence.
Type II systems lack the Cas6 gene and instead utilize RNaseIII for cleavage",CRISPR
"Functional type II systems encode an extra small RNA that is complementary to the repeat sequence, known as a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA)",CRISPR
"Transcription of the tracrRNA and the primary CRISPR transcript results in base pairing and the formation of dsRNA at the repeat sequence, which is subsequently targeted by RNaseIII to produce crRNAs",CRISPR
"Unlike the other two systems, the crRNA does not contain the full spacer, which is instead truncated at one end.
CrRNAs associate with Cas proteins to form ribonucleotide complexes that recognize foreign nucleic acids",CRISPR
"CrRNAs show no preference between the coding and non-coding strands, which is indicative of an RNA-guided DNA-targeting system",CRISPR
"The type I-E complex (commonly referred to as Cascade) requires five Cas proteins bound to a single crRNA.


=== Interference ===
During the interference stage in type I systems, the PAM sequence is recognized on the crRNA-complementary strand and is required along with crRNA annealing",CRISPR
"In type I systems correct base pairing between the crRNA and the protospacer signals a conformational change in Cascade that recruits Cas3 for DNA degradation.
Type II systems rely on a single multifunctional protein, Cas9, for the interference step",CRISPR
Cas9 requires both the crRNA and the tracrRNA to function and cleave DNA using its dual HNH and RuvC/RNaseH-like endonuclease domains,CRISPR
Basepairing between the PAM and the phage genome is required in type II systems,CRISPR
"However, the PAM is recognized on the same strand as the crRNA (the opposite strand to type I systems).
Type III systems, like type I require six or seven Cas proteins binding to crRNAs",CRISPR
"furiosus both target the mRNA of phages rather than phage DNA genome, which may make these systems uniquely capable of targeting RNA-based phage genomes",CRISPR
"Type III systems were also found to target DNA in addition to RNA using a different Cas protein in the complex, Cas10",CRISPR
"The DNA cleavage was shown to be transcription dependent.
The mechanism for distinguishing self from foreign DNA during interference is built into the crRNAs and is therefore likely common to all three systems",CRISPR
"Throughout the distinctive maturation process of each major type, all crRNAs contain a spacer sequence and some portion of the repeat at one or both ends",CRISPR
It is the partial repeat sequence that prevents the CRISPR-Cas system from targeting the chromosome as base pairing beyond the spacer sequence signals self and prevents DNA cleavage,CRISPR
"RNA-guided CRISPR enzymes are classified as type V restriction enzymes.


== Evolution ==

The cas genes in the adaptor and effector modules of the CRISPR-Cas system are believed to have evolved from two different ancestral modules",CRISPR
"A transposon-like element called casposon encoding the Cas1-like integrase and potentially other components of the adaptation module was inserted next to the ancestral effector module, which likely functioned as an independent innate immune system",CRISPR
The highly conserved cas1 and cas2 genes of the adaptor module evolved from the ancestral module while a variety of class 1 effector cas genes evolved from the ancestral effector module,CRISPR
"The evolution of these various class 1 effector module cas genes was guided by various mechanisms, such as duplication events",CRISPR
"On the other hand, each type of class 2 effector module arose from subsequent independent insertions of mobile genetic elements",CRISPR
These mobile genetic elements took the place of the multiple gene effector modules to create single gene effector modules that produce large proteins which perform all the necessary tasks of the effector module,CRISPR
The spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are taken directly from foreign mobile genetic elements and thus their long-term evolution is hard to trace,CRISPR
"The non-random evolution of these spacer regions has been found to be highly dependent on the environment and the particular foreign mobile genetic elements it contains.
CRISPR-Cas can immunize bacteria against certain phages and thus halt transmission",CRISPR
"For this reason, Koonin described CRISPR-Cas as a Lamarckian inheritance mechanism",CRISPR
"However, this was disputed by a critic who noted, ""We should remember [Lamarck] for the good he contributed to science, not for things that resemble his theory only superficially",CRISPR
"Indeed, thinking of CRISPR and other phenomena as Lamarckian only obscures the simple and elegant way evolution really works""",CRISPR
"But as more recent studies have been conducted, it has become apparent that the acquired spacer regions of CRISPR-Cas systems are indeed a form of Lamarckian evolution because they are genetic mutations that are acquired and then passed on",CRISPR
"On the other hand, the evolution of the Cas gene machinery that facilitates the system evolves through classic Darwinian evolution.


=== Coevolution ===
Analysis of CRISPR sequences revealed coevolution of host and viral genomes.
The basic model of CRISPR evolution is newly incorporated spacers driving phages to mutate their genomes to avoid the bacterial immune response, creating diversity in both the phage and host populations",CRISPR
"To resist a phage infection, the sequence of the CRISPR spacer must correspond perfectly to the sequence of the target phage gene",CRISPR
Phages can continue to infect their hosts' given point mutations in the spacer,CRISPR
"Similar stringency is required in PAM or the bacterial strain remains phage sensitive.


=== Rates ===
A study of 124 S",CRISPR
thermophilus strains showed that 26% of all spacers were unique and that different CRISPR loci showed different rates of spacer acquisition,CRISPR
"Some CRISPR loci evolve more rapidly than others, which allowed the strains' phylogenetic relationships to be determined",CRISPR
"The latter's strains that diverged 250,000 years ago still contained the same spacer complement.
Metagenomic analysis of two acid-mine-drainage biofilms showed that one of the analyzed CRISPRs contained extensive deletions and spacer additions versus the other biofilm, suggesting a higher phage activity/prevalence in one community than the other",CRISPR
"In the oral cavity, a temporal study determined that 7–22% of spacers were shared over 17 months within an individual while less than 2% were shared across individuals.
From the same environment, a single strain was tracked using PCR primers specific to its CRISPR system",CRISPR
"However, this CRISPR added three spacers over 17 months, suggesting that even in an environment with significant CRISPR diversity some loci evolve slowly.
CRISPRs were analysed from the metagenomes produced for the Human Microbiome Project",CRISPR
"Although most were body-site specific, some within a body site are widely shared among individuals",CRISPR
"One of these loci originated from streptococcal species and contained ≈15,000 spacers, 50% of which were unique",CRISPR
"Similar to the targeted studies of the oral cavity, some showed little evolution over time.
CRISPR evolution was studied in chemostats using S",CRISPR
thermophilus strains acquired up to three spacers when challenged with a single phage,CRISPR
"During the same interval, the phage developed single-nucleotide polymorphisms that became fixed in the population, suggesting that targeting had prevented phage replication absent these mutations.
Another S",CRISPR
thermophilus experiment showed that phages can infect and replicate in hosts that have only one targeting spacer,CRISPR
Yet another showed that sensitive hosts can exist in environments with high-phage titres,CRISPR
"The chemostat and observational studies suggest many nuances to CRISPR and phage (co)evolution.


== Identification ==
CRISPRs are widely distributed among bacteria and archaea and show some sequence similarities",CRISPR
Their most notable characteristic is their repeating spacers and direct repeats,CRISPR
"This characteristic makes CRISPRs easily identifiable in long sequences of DNA, since the number of repeats decreases the likelihood of a false positive match.
Analysis of CRISPRs in metagenomic data is more challenging, as CRISPR loci do not typically assemble, due to their repetitive nature or through strain variation, which confuses assembly algorithms",CRISPR
"Where many reference genomes are available, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) can be used to amplify CRISPR arrays and analyse spacer content",CRISPR
"However, this approach yields information only for specifically targeted CRISPRs and for organisms with sufficient representation in public databases to design reliable polymerase PCR primers",CRISPR
"Degenerate repeat-specific primers can be used to amplify CRISPR spacers directly from environmental samples; amplicons containing two or three spacers can be then computationally assembled to reconstruct long CRISPR arrays.
The alternative is to extract and reconstruct CRISPR arrays from shotgun metagenomic data",CRISPR
"This is computationally more difficult, particularly with second generation sequencing technologies (e.g",CRISPR
"454, Illumina), as the short read lengths prevent more than two or three repeat units appearing in a single read",CRISPR
"CRISPR identification in raw reads has been achieved using purely de novo identification or by using direct repeat sequences in partially assembled CRISPR arrays from contigs (overlapping DNA segments that together represent a consensus region of DNA) and direct repeat sequences from published genomes as a hook for identifying direct repeats in individual reads.


== Use by phages ==
Another way for bacteria to defend against phage infection is by having chromosomal islands",CRISPR
A subtype of chromosomal islands called phage-inducible chromosomal island (PICI) is excised from a bacterial chromosome upon phage infection and can inhibit phage replication,CRISPR
"PICIs are induced, excised, replicated, and finally packaged into small capsids by certain staphylococcal temperate phages",CRISPR
"In the first mechanism, PICI-encoded Ppi differentially blocks phage maturation by binding or interacting specifically with phage TerS, hence blocking phage TerS/TerL complex formation responsible for phage DNA packaging",CRISPR
In the second mechanism PICI CpmAB redirects the phage capsid morphogenetic protein to make 95% of SaPI-sized capsid and phage DNA can package only 1/3rd of their genome in these small capsids and hence become nonviable phage,CRISPR
"The third mechanism involves two proteins, PtiA and PtiB, that target the LtrC, which is responsible for the production of virion and lysis proteins",CRISPR
"This interference mechanism is modulated by a modulatory protein, PtiM, binds to one of the interference-mediating proteins, PtiA, and hence achieves the required level of interference.
One study showed that lytic ICP1 phage, which specifically targets Vibrio cholerae serogroup O1, has acquired a CRISPR-Cas system that targets a V",CRISPR
The system has 2 CRISPR loci and 9 Cas genes,CRISPR
It seems to be homologous to the I-F system found in Yersinia pestis,CRISPR
"Moreover, like the bacterial CRISPR-Cas system, ICP1 CRISPR-Cas can acquire new sequences, which allows phage and host to co-evolve.
Certain archaeal viruses were shown to carry mini-CRISPR arrays containing one or two spacers",CRISPR
"It has been shown that spacers within the virus-borne CRISPR arrays target other viruses and plasmids, suggesting that mini-CRISPR arrays represent a mechanism of heterotypic superinfection exclusion and participate in interviral conflicts.


== Applications ==

CRISPR gene editing is a revolutionary technology that allows for precise, targeted modifications to the DNA of living organisms",CRISPR
"Developed from a natural defense mechanism found in bacteria, CRISPR-Cas9 is the most commonly used system, that allows ""cutting"" of DNA at specific locations and either delete, modify, or insert genetic material",CRISPR
"This technology has transformed fields such as genetics, medicine, and agriculture, offering potential treatments for genetic disorders, advancements in crop engineering, and research into the fundamental workings of life",CRISPR
"However, its ethical implications and potential unintended consequences have sparked significant debate.

"So far, all tests of general relativity have been shown to be in agreement with the theory",General Relativity
"The time-dependent solutions of general relativity enable us to talk about the history of the universe and have provided the modern framework for cosmology, thus leading to the discovery of the Big Bang and cosmic microwave background radiation",General Relativity

== History ==

Henri Poincaré's 1905 theory of the dynamics of the electron was a relativistic theory which he applied to all forces, including gravity",General Relativity
" While others thought that gravity was instantaneous or of electromagnetic origin, he suggested that relativity was ""something due to our methods of measurement""",General Relativity
"In his theory, he showed that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light",General Relativity
"Soon afterwards, Einstein started thinking about how to incorporate gravity into his relativistic framework",General Relativity
"In 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall (FFO), he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity",General Relativity
"After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations, which form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity",General Relativity
These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present,General Relativity
"A version of non-Euclidean geometry, called Riemannian geometry, enabled Einstein to develop general relativity by providing the key mathematical framework on which he fit his physical ideas of gravity",General Relativity
"This idea was pointed out by mathematician Marcel Grossmann and published by Grossmann and Einstein in 1913.
The Einstein field equations are nonlinear and considered difficult to solve",General Relativity
Einstein used approximation methods in working out initial predictions of the theory,General Relativity
"But in 1916, the astrophysicist Karl Schwarzschild found the first non-trivial exact solution to the Einstein field equations, the Schwarzschild metric",General Relativity
"This solution laid the groundwork for the description of the final stages of gravitational collapse, and the objects known today as black holes",General Relativity
"In the same year, the first steps towards generalizing Schwarzschild's solution to electrically charged objects were taken, eventually resulting in the Reissner–Nordström solution, which is now associated with electrically charged black holes",General Relativity
"In 1917, Einstein applied his theory to the universe as a whole, initiating the field of relativistic cosmology",General Relativity
"In line with contemporary thinking, he assumed a static universe, adding a new parameter to his original field equations—the cosmological constant—to match that observational presumption",General Relativity
"By 1929, however, the work of Hubble and others had shown that our universe is expanding",General Relativity
"This is readily described by the expanding cosmological solutions found by Friedmann in 1922, which do not require a cosmological constant",General Relativity
"Lemaître used these solutions to formulate the earliest version of the Big Bang models, in which our universe has evolved from an extremely hot and dense earlier state",General Relativity
"Einstein later declared the cosmological constant the biggest blunder of his life.
During that period, general relativity remained something of a curiosity among physical theories",General Relativity
"It was clearly superior to Newtonian gravity, being consistent with special relativity and accounting for several effects unexplained by the Newtonian theory",General Relativity
"Einstein showed in 1915 how his theory explained the anomalous perihelion advance of the planet Mercury without any arbitrary parameters (""fudge factors""), and in 1919 an expedition led by Eddington confirmed general relativity's prediction for the deflection of starlight by the Sun during the total solar eclipse of 29 May 1919, instantly making Einstein famous",General Relativity
"Yet the theory remained outside the mainstream of theoretical physics and astrophysics until developments between approximately 1960 and 1975, now known as the golden age of general relativity",General Relativity
"Physicists began to understand the concept of a black hole, and to identify quasars as one of these objects' astrophysical manifestations",General Relativity
"Ever more precise solar system tests confirmed the theory's predictive power, and relativistic cosmology also became amenable to direct observational tests.
General relativity has acquired a reputation as a theory of extraordinary beauty",General Relativity
"Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar has noted that at multiple levels, general relativity exhibits what Francis Bacon has termed a ""strangeness in the proportion"" (i.e",General Relativity
It juxtaposes fundamental concepts (space and time versus matter and motion) which had previously been considered as entirely independent,General Relativity
"Chandrasekhar also noted that Einstein's only guides in his search for an exact theory were the principle of equivalence and his sense that a proper description of gravity should be geometrical at its basis, so that there was an ""element of revelation"" in the manner in which Einstein arrived at his theory",General Relativity
"Other elements of beauty associated with the general theory of relativity are its simplicity and symmetry, the manner in which it incorporates invariance and unification, and its perfect logical consistency.
In the preface to Relativity: The Special and the General Theory, Einstein said ""The present book is intended, as far as possible, to give an exact insight into the theory of Relativity to those readers who, from a general scientific and philosophical point of view, are interested in the theory, but who are not conversant with the mathematical apparatus of theoretical physics",General Relativity
"The work presumes a standard of education corresponding to that of a university matriculation examination, and, despite the shortness of the book, a fair amount of patience and force of will on the part of the reader",General Relativity
"The author has spared himself no pains in his endeavour to present the main ideas in the simplest and most intelligible form, and on the whole, in the sequence and connection in which they actually originated.""


== From classical mechanics to general relativity ==
General relativity can be understood by examining its similarities with and departures from classical physics",General Relativity
The first step is the realization that classical mechanics and Newton's law of gravity admit a geometric description,General Relativity
"The combination of this description with the laws of special relativity results in a heuristic derivation of general relativity.


=== Geometry of Newtonian gravity ===

At the base of classical mechanics is the notion that a body's motion can be described as a combination of free (or inertial) motion, and deviations from this free motion",General Relativity
"Such deviations are caused by external forces acting on a body in accordance with Newton's second law of motion, which states that the net force acting on a body is equal to that body's (inertial) mass multiplied by its acceleration",General Relativity
"The preferred inertial motions are related to the geometry of space and time: in the standard reference frames of classical mechanics, objects in free motion move along straight lines at constant speed",General Relativity
"In modern parlance, their paths are geodesics, straight world lines in curved spacetime.
Conversely, one might expect that inertial motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), can be used to define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate",General Relativity
"However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play",General Relativity
"According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): the trajectory of a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties",General Relativity
"A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in an enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping the trajectory of bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is stationary in a gravitational field and the ball accelerating, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field versus the ball which upon release has nil acceleration.
Given the universality of free fall, there is no observable distinction between inertial motion and motion under the influence of the gravitational force",General Relativity
"This suggests the definition of a new class of inertial motion, namely that of objects in free fall under the influence of gravity",General Relativity
"This new class of preferred motions, too, defines a geometry of space and time—in mathematical terms, it is the geodesic motion associated with a specific connection which depends on the gradient of the gravitational potential",General Relativity
"Space, in this construction, still has the ordinary Euclidean geometry",General Relativity
"As can be shown using simple thought experiments following the free-fall trajectories of different test particles, the result of transporting spacetime vectors that can denote a particle's velocity (time-like vectors) will vary with the particle's trajectory; mathematically speaking, the Newtonian connection is not integrable",General Relativity
"The resulting Newton–Cartan theory is a geometric formulation of Newtonian gravity using only covariant concepts, i.e",General Relativity
a description which is valid in any desired coordinate system,General Relativity
"In this geometric description, tidal effects—the relative acceleration of bodies in free fall—are related to the derivative of the connection, showing how the modified geometry is caused by the presence of mass.


=== Relativistic generalization ===

As intriguing as geometric Newtonian gravity may be, its basis, classical mechanics, is merely a limiting case of (special) relativistic mechanics",General Relativity
"In the language of symmetry: where gravity can be neglected, physics is Lorentz invariant as in special relativity rather than Galilei invariant as in classical mechanics",General Relativity
"(The defining symmetry of special relativity is the Poincaré group, which includes translations, rotations, boosts and reflections.) The differences between the two become significant when dealing with speeds approaching the speed of light, and with high-energy phenomena.
With Lorentz symmetry, additional structures come into play",General Relativity
They are defined by the set of light cones (see image),General Relativity
"The light-cones define a causal structure: for each event A, there is a set of events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image)",General Relativity
"In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the spacetime's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor",General Relativity
"In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.
Special relativity is defined in the absence of gravity",General Relativity
"For practical applications, it is a suitable model whenever gravity can be neglected",General Relativity
"Bringing gravity into play, and assuming the universality of free fall motion, an analogous reasoning as in the previous section applies: there are no global inertial frames",General Relativity
Instead there are approximate inertial frames moving alongside freely falling particles,General Relativity
"Translated into the language of spacetime: the straight time-like lines that define a gravity-free inertial frame are deformed to lines that are curved relative to each other, suggesting that the inclusion of gravity necessitates a change in spacetime geometry.
A priori, it is not clear whether the new local frames in free fall coincide with the reference frames in which the laws of special relativity hold—that theory is based on the propagation of light, and thus on electromagnetism, which could have a different set of preferred frames",General Relativity
"But using different assumptions about the special-relativistic frames (such as their being earth-fixed, or in free fall), one can derive different predictions for the gravitational redshift, that is, the way in which the frequency of light shifts as the light propagates through a gravitational field (cf",General Relativity
The actual measurements show that free-falling frames are the ones in which light propagates as it does in special relativity,General Relativity
"The generalization of this statement, namely that the laws of special relativity hold to good approximation in freely falling (and non-rotating) reference frames, is known as the Einstein equivalence principle, a crucial guiding principle for generalizing special-relativistic physics to include gravity.
The same experimental data shows that time as measured by clocks in a gravitational field—proper time, to give the technical term—does not follow the rules of special relativity",General Relativity
"In the language of spacetime geometry, it is not measured by the Minkowski metric",General Relativity
"As in the Newtonian case, this is suggestive of a more general geometry",General Relativity
"At small scales, all reference frames that are in free fall are equivalent, and approximately Minkowskian",General Relativity
"Consequently, we are now dealing with a curved generalization of Minkowski space",General Relativity
"The metric tensor that defines the geometry—in particular, how lengths and angles are measured—is not the Minkowski metric of special relativity, it is a generalization known as a semi- or pseudo-Riemannian metric",General Relativity
"Furthermore, each Riemannian metric is naturally associated with one particular kind of connection, the Levi-Civita connection, and this is, in fact, the connection that satisfies the equivalence principle and makes space locally Minkowskian (that is, in suitable locally inertial coordinates, the metric is Minkowskian, and its first partial derivatives and the connection coefficients vanish).


=== Einstein's equations ===

Having formulated the relativistic, geometric version of the effects of gravity, the question of gravity's source remains",General Relativity
"In special relativity, mass turns out to be part of a more general quantity called the energy–momentum tensor, which includes both energy and momentum densities as well as stress: pressure and shear",General Relativity
"Using the equivalence principle, this tensor is readily generalized to curved spacetime",General Relativity
"Drawing further upon the analogy with geometric Newtonian gravity, it is natural to assume that the field equation for gravity relates this tensor and the Ricci tensor, which describes a particular class of tidal effects: the change in volume for a small cloud of test particles that are initially at rest, and then fall freely",General Relativity
"In special relativity, conservation of energy–momentum corresponds to the statement that the energy–momentum tensor is divergence-free",General Relativity
"This formula, too, is readily generalized to curved spacetime by replacing partial derivatives with their curved-manifold counterparts, covariant derivatives studied in differential geometry",General Relativity
"With this additional condition—the covariant divergence of the energy–momentum tensor, and hence of whatever is on the other side of the equation, is zero—the simplest nontrivial set of equations are what are called Einstein's (field) equations:

On the left-hand side is the Einstein tensor,

where L is the angular momentum",General Relativity
"The first term represents the force of Newtonian gravity, which is described by the inverse-square law",General Relativity
The second term represents the centrifugal force in the circular motion,General Relativity
"The third term represents the relativistic effect.


=== Alternatives to general relativity ===

There are alternatives to general relativity built upon the same premises, which include additional rules and/or constraints, leading to different field equations",General Relativity
"Examples are Whitehead's theory, Brans–Dicke theory, teleparallelism, f(R) gravity and Einstein–Cartan theory.


== Definition and basic applications ==

The derivation outlined in the previous section contains all the information needed to define general relativity, describe its key properties, and address a question of crucial importance in physics, namely how the theory can be used for model-building.


=== Definition and basic properties ===
General relativity is a metric theory of gravitation",General Relativity
"At its core are Einstein's equations, which describe the relation between the geometry of a four-dimensional pseudo-Riemannian manifold representing spacetime, and the energy–momentum contained in that spacetime",General Relativity
"Phenomena that in classical mechanics are ascribed to the action of the force of gravity (such as free-fall, orbital motion, and spacecraft trajectories), correspond to inertial motion within a curved geometry of spacetime in general relativity; there is no gravitational force deflecting objects from their natural, straight paths",General Relativity
"Instead, gravity corresponds to changes in the properties of space and time, which in turn changes the straightest-possible paths that objects will naturally follow",General Relativity
"The curvature is, in turn, caused by the energy–momentum of matter",General Relativity
"Paraphrasing the relativist John Archibald Wheeler, spacetime tells matter how to move; matter tells spacetime how to curve.
While general relativity replaces the scalar gravitational potential of classical physics by a symmetric rank-two tensor, the latter reduces to the former in certain limiting cases",General Relativity
"For weak gravitational fields and slow speed relative to the speed of light, the theory's predictions converge on those of Newton's law of universal gravitation.
As it is constructed using tensors, general relativity exhibits general covariance: its laws—and further laws formulated within the general relativistic framework—take on the same form in all coordinate systems",General Relativity
"Furthermore, the theory does not contain any invariant geometric background structures, i.e",General Relativity
"It thus satisfies a more stringent general principle of relativity, namely that the laws of physics are the same for all observers",General Relativity
"Locally, as expressed in the equivalence principle, spacetime is Minkowskian, and the laws of physics exhibit local Lorentz invariance.


=== Model-building ===
The core concept of general-relativistic model-building is that of a solution of Einstein's equations",General Relativity
"Given both Einstein's equations and suitable equations for the properties of matter, such a solution consists of a specific semi-Riemannian manifold (usually defined by giving the metric in specific coordinates), and specific matter fields defined on that manifold",General Relativity
"Matter and geometry must satisfy Einstein's equations, so in particular, the matter's energy–momentum tensor must be divergence-free",General Relativity
"The matter must, of course, also satisfy whatever additional equations were imposed on its properties",General Relativity
"In short, such a solution is a model universe that satisfies the laws of general relativity, and possibly additional laws governing whatever matter might be present.
Einstein's equations are nonlinear partial differential equations and, as such, difficult to solve exactly",General Relativity
"Nevertheless, a number of exact solutions are known, although only a few have direct physical applications",General Relativity
"The best-known exact solutions, and also those most interesting from a physics point of view, are the Schwarzschild solution, the Reissner–Nordström solution and the Kerr metric, each corresponding to a certain type of black hole in an otherwise empty universe, and the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker and de Sitter universes, each describing an expanding cosmos",General Relativity
"Exact solutions of great theoretical interest include the Gödel universe (which opens up the intriguing possibility of time travel in curved spacetimes), the Taub–NUT solution (a model universe that is homogeneous, but anisotropic), and anti-de Sitter space (which has recently come to prominence in the context of what is called the Maldacena conjecture).
Given the difficulty of finding exact solutions, Einstein's field equations are also solved frequently by numerical integration on a computer, or by considering small perturbations of exact solutions",General Relativity
"In the field of numerical relativity, powerful computers are employed to simulate the geometry of spacetime and to solve Einstein's equations for interesting situations such as two colliding black holes",General Relativity
"In principle, such methods may be applied to any system, given sufficient computer resources, and may address fundamental questions such as naked singularities",General Relativity
"Approximate solutions may also be found by perturbation theories such as linearized gravity and its generalization, the post-Newtonian expansion, both of which were developed by Einstein",General Relativity
The latter provides a systematic approach to solving for the geometry of a spacetime that contains a distribution of matter that moves slowly compared with the speed of light,General Relativity
"The expansion involves a series of terms; the first terms represent Newtonian gravity, whereas the later terms represent ever smaller corrections to Newton's theory due to general relativity",General Relativity
"An extension of this expansion is the parametrized post-Newtonian (PPN) formalism, which allows quantitative comparisons between the predictions of general relativity and alternative theories.


== Consequences of Einstein's theory ==
General relativity has a number of physical consequences",General Relativity
"Some follow directly from the theory's axioms, whereas others have become clear only in the course of many years of research that followed Einstein's initial publication.


=== Gravitational time dilation and frequency shift ===

Assuming that the equivalence principle holds, gravity influences the passage of time",General Relativity
"Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent in the opposite direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift",General Relativity
"More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.
Gravitational redshift has been measured in the laboratory and using astronomical observations",General Relativity
"Gravitational time dilation in the Earth's gravitational field has been measured numerous times using atomic clocks, while ongoing validation is provided as a side effect of the operation of the Global Positioning System (GPS)",General Relativity
Tests in stronger gravitational fields are provided by the observation of binary pulsars,General Relativity
"However, at the current level of accuracy, these observations cannot distinguish between general relativity and other theories in which the equivalence principle is valid.


=== Light deflection and gravitational time delay ===

General relativity predicts that the path of light will follow the curvature of spacetime as it passes near a star",General Relativity
"This effect was initially confirmed by observing the light of stars or distant quasars being deflected as it passes the Sun.
This and related predictions follow from the fact that light follows what is called a light-like or null geodesic—a generalization of the straight lines along which light travels in classical physics",General Relativity
Such geodesics are the generalization of the invariance of lightspeed in special relativity,General Relativity
"As one examines suitable model spacetimes (either the exterior Schwarzschild solution or, for more than a single mass, the post-Newtonian expansion), several effects of gravity on light propagation emerge",General Relativity
"Although the bending of light can also be derived by extending the universality of free fall to light, the angle of deflection resulting from such calculations is only half the value given by general relativity.
Closely related to light deflection is the Shapiro Time Delay, the phenomenon that light signals take longer to move through a gravitational field than they would in the absence of that field",General Relativity
"In the parameterized post-Newtonian formalism (PPN), measurements of both the deflection of light and the gravitational time delay determine a parameter called γ, which encodes the influence of gravity on the geometry of space.


=== Gravitational waves ===

Predicted in 1916 by Albert Einstein, there are gravitational waves: ripples in the metric of spacetime that propagate at the speed of light",General Relativity
"These are one of several analogies between weak-field gravity and electromagnetism in that, they are analogous to electromagnetic waves",General Relativity
"On 11 February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had directly detected gravitational waves from a pair of black holes merging.
The simplest type of such a wave can be visualized by its action on a ring of freely floating particles",General Relativity
"A sine wave propagating through such a ring towards the reader distorts the ring in a characteristic, rhythmic fashion (animated image to the right)",General Relativity
"Since Einstein's equations are non-linear, arbitrarily strong gravitational waves do not obey linear superposition, making their description difficult",General Relativity
"However, linear approximations of gravitational waves are sufficiently accurate to describe the exceedingly weak waves that are expected to arrive here on Earth from far-off cosmic events, which typically result in relative distances increasing and decreasing by

    {\displaystyle 10^{-21}}
  
 or less",General Relativity
"Data analysis methods routinely make use of the fact that these linearized waves can be Fourier decomposed.
Some exact solutions describe gravitational waves without any approximation, e.g., a wave train traveling through empty space or Gowdy universes, varieties of an expanding cosmos filled with gravitational waves",General Relativity
"But for gravitational waves produced in astrophysically relevant situations, such as the merger of two black holes, numerical methods are presently the only way to construct appropriate models.


=== Orbital effects and the relativity of direction ===

General relativity differs from classical mechanics in a number of predictions concerning orbiting bodies",General Relativity
"It predicts an overall rotation (precession) of planetary orbits, as well as orbital decay caused by the emission of gravitational waves and effects related to the relativity of direction.


==== Precession of apsides ====

In general relativity, the apsides of any orbit (the point of the orbiting body's closest approach to the system's center of mass) will precess; the orbit is not an ellipse, but akin to an ellipse that rotates on its focus, resulting in a rose curve-like shape (see image)",General Relativity
Einstein first derived this result by using an approximate metric representing the Newtonian limit and treating the orbiting body as a test particle,General Relativity
"For him, the fact that his theory gave a straightforward explanation of Mercury's anomalous perihelion shift, discovered earlier by Urbain Le Verrier in 1859, was important evidence that he had at last identified the correct form of the gravitational field equations.
The effect can also be derived by using either the exact Schwarzschild metric (describing spacetime around a spherical mass) or the much more general post-Newtonian formalism",General Relativity
It is due to the influence of gravity on the geometry of space and to the contribution of self-energy to a body's gravity (encoded in the nonlinearity of Einstein's equations),General Relativity
"Relativistic precession has been observed for all planets that allow for accurate precession measurements (Mercury, Venus, and Earth), as well as in binary pulsar systems, where it is larger by five orders of magnitude.
In general relativity the perihelion shift

, expressed in radians per revolution, is approximately given by

 is the speed of light in vacuum

  
    
      
        e
      
    
    {\displaystyle e}
  
 is the orbital eccentricity


==== Orbital decay ====

According to general relativity, a binary system will emit gravitational waves, thereby losing energy",General Relativity
"Due to this loss, the distance between the two orbiting bodies decreases, and so does their orbital period",General Relativity
"Within the Solar System or for ordinary double stars, the effect is too small to be observable",General Relativity
"This is not the case for a close binary pulsar, a system of two orbiting neutron stars, one of which is a pulsar: from the pulsar, observers on Earth receive a regular series of radio pulses that can serve as a highly accurate clock, which allows precise measurements of the orbital period",General Relativity
"Because neutron stars are immensely compact, significant amounts of energy are emitted in the form of gravitational radiation.
The first observation of a decrease in orbital period due to the emission of gravitational waves was made by Hulse and Taylor, using the binary pulsar PSR1913+16 they had discovered in 1974",General Relativity
"This was the first detection of gravitational waves, albeit indirect, for which they were awarded the 1993 Nobel Prize in physics",General Relativity
"Since then, several other binary pulsars have been found, in particular the double pulsar PSR J0737−3039, where both stars are pulsars and which was last reported to also be in agreement with general relativity in 2021 after 16 years of observations.


==== Geodetic precession and frame-dragging ====

Several relativistic effects are directly related to the relativity of direction",General Relativity
"One is geodetic precession: the axis direction of a gyroscope in free fall in curved spacetime will change when compared, for instance, with the direction of light received from distant stars—even though such a gyroscope represents the way of keeping a direction as stable as possible (""parallel transport"")",General Relativity
"For the Moon–Earth system, this effect has been measured with the help of lunar laser ranging",General Relativity
"More recently, it has been measured for test masses aboard the satellite Gravity Probe B to a precision of better than 0.3%.
Near a rotating mass, there are gravitomagnetic or frame-dragging effects",General Relativity
"A distant observer will determine that objects close to the mass get ""dragged around""",General Relativity
"This is most extreme for rotating black holes where, for any object entering a zone known as the ergosphere, rotation is inevitable",General Relativity
Such effects can again be tested through their influence on the orientation of gyroscopes in free fall,General Relativity
"Somewhat controversial tests have been performed using the LAGEOS satellites, confirming the relativistic prediction",General Relativity
"Also the Mars Global Surveyor probe around Mars has been used.


== Astrophysical applications ==


=== Gravitational lensing ===

The deflection of light by gravity is responsible for a new class of astronomical phenomena",General Relativity
"If a massive object is situated between the astronomer and a distant target object with appropriate mass and relative distances, the astronomer will see multiple distorted images of the target",General Relativity
"Depending on the configuration, scale, and mass distribution, there can be two or more images, a bright ring known as an Einstein ring, or partial rings called arcs.
The earliest example was discovered in 1979; since then, more than a hundred gravitational lenses have been observed",General Relativity
"Even if the multiple images are too close to each other to be resolved, the effect can still be measured, e.g., as an overall brightening of the target object; a number of such ""microlensing events"" have been observed.
Gravitational lensing has developed into a tool of observational astronomy",General Relativity
"It is used to detect the presence and distribution of dark matter, provide a ""natural telescope"" for observing distant galaxies, and to obtain an independent estimate of the Hubble constant",General Relativity
"Statistical evaluations of lensing data provide valuable insight into the structural evolution of galaxies.


=== Gravitational-wave astronomy ===

Observations of binary pulsars provide strong indirect evidence for the existence of gravitational waves (see Orbital decay, above)",General Relativity
Detection of these waves is a major goal of current relativity-related research,General Relativity
"Several land-based gravitational wave detectors are currently in operation, most notably the interferometric detectors GEO 600, LIGO (two detectors), TAMA 300 and VIRGO",General Relativity
"Various pulsar timing arrays are using millisecond pulsars to detect gravitational waves in the 10−9 to 10−6 hertz frequency range, which originate from binary supermassive blackholes",General Relativity
"A European space-based detector, eLISA / NGO, is currently under development, with a precursor mission (LISA Pathfinder) having launched in December 2015.
Observations of gravitational waves promise to complement observations in the electromagnetic spectrum",General Relativity
"They are expected to yield information about black holes and other dense objects such as neutron stars and white dwarfs, about certain kinds of supernova implosions, and about processes in the very early universe, including the signature of certain types of hypothetical cosmic string",General Relativity
"In February 2016, the Advanced LIGO team announced that they had detected gravitational waves from a black hole merger.


=== Black holes and other compact objects ===

Whenever the ratio of an object's mass to its radius becomes sufficiently large, general relativity predicts the formation of a black hole, a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape",General Relativity
"In the currently accepted models of stellar evolution, neutron stars of around 1.4 solar masses, and stellar black holes with a few to a few dozen solar masses, are thought to be the final state for the evolution of massive stars",General Relativity
"Usually a galaxy has one supermassive black hole with a few million to a few billion solar masses in its center, and its presence is thought to have played an important role in the formation of the galaxy and larger cosmic structures.
Astronomically, the most important property of compact objects is that they provide a supremely efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into electromagnetic radiation",General Relativity
"Accretion, the falling of dust or gaseous matter onto stellar or supermassive black holes, is thought to be responsible for some spectacularly luminous astronomical objects, notably diverse kinds of active galactic nuclei on galactic scales and stellar-size objects such as microquasars",General Relativity
"In particular, accretion can lead to relativistic jets, focused beams of highly energetic particles that are being flung into space at almost light speed.
General relativity plays a central role in modelling all these phenomena, and observations provide strong evidence for the existence of black holes with the properties predicted by the theory.
Black holes are also sought-after targets in the search for gravitational waves (cf",General Relativity
"Merging black hole binaries should lead to some of the strongest gravitational wave signals reaching detectors here on Earth, and the phase directly before the merger (""chirp"") could be used as a ""standard candle"" to deduce the distance to the merger events–and hence serve as a probe of cosmic expansion at large distances",General Relativity
"The gravitational waves produced as a stellar black hole plunges into a supermassive one should provide direct information about the supermassive black hole's geometry.

"Isotropic and homogeneous solutions of these enhanced equations, the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solutions, allow physicists to model a universe that has evolved over the past 14 billion years from a hot, early Big Bang phase",General Relativity
"Once a small number of parameters (for example the universe's mean matter density) have been fixed by astronomical observation, further observational data can be used to put the models to the test",General Relativity
"Predictions, all successful, include the initial abundance of chemical elements formed in a period of primordial nucleosynthesis, the large-scale structure of the universe, and the existence and properties of a ""thermal echo"" from the early cosmos, the cosmic background radiation.
Astronomical observations of the cosmological expansion rate allow the total amount of matter in the universe to be estimated, although the nature of that matter remains mysterious in part",General Relativity
"About 90% of all matter appears to be dark matter, which has mass (or, equivalently, gravitational influence), but does not interact electromagnetically and, hence, cannot be observed directly",General Relativity
"There is no generally accepted description of this new kind of matter, within the framework of known particle physics or otherwise",General Relativity
"Observational evidence from redshift surveys of distant supernovae and measurements of the cosmic background radiation also show that the evolution of our universe is significantly influenced by a cosmological constant resulting in an acceleration of cosmic expansion or, equivalently, by a form of energy with an unusual equation of state, known as dark energy, the nature of which remains unclear.
An inflationary phase, an additional phase of strongly accelerated expansion at cosmic times of around 10−33 seconds, was hypothesized in 1980 to account for several puzzling observations that were unexplained by classical cosmological models, such as the nearly perfect homogeneity of the cosmic background radiation",General Relativity
Recent measurements of the cosmic background radiation have resulted in the first evidence for this scenario,General Relativity
"However, there is a bewildering variety of possible inflationary scenarios, which cannot be restricted by current observations",General Relativity
"An even larger question is the physics of the earliest universe, prior to the inflationary phase and close to where the classical models predict the big bang singularity",General Relativity
"An authoritative answer would require a complete theory of quantum gravity, which has not yet been developed (cf",General Relativity
"the section on quantum gravity, below).


=== Exotic solutions: time travel, warp drives ===
Kurt Gödel showed that solutions to Einstein's equations exist that contain closed timelike curves (CTCs), which allow for loops in time",General Relativity
"The solutions require extreme physical conditions unlikely ever to occur in practice, and it remains an open question whether further laws of physics will eliminate them completely",General Relativity
"Since then, other—similarly impractical—GR solutions containing CTCs have been found, such as the Tipler cylinder and traversable wormholes",General Relativity
"Stephen Hawking introduced chronology protection conjecture, which is an assumption beyond those of standard general relativity to prevent time travel.
Some exact solutions in general relativity such as Alcubierre drive present examples of warp drive but these solutions requires exotic matter distribution, and generally suffers from semiclassical instability.


== Advanced concepts ==


=== Asymptotic symmetries ===

The spacetime symmetry group for special relativity is the Poincaré group, which is a ten-dimensional group of three Lorentz boosts, three rotations, and four spacetime translations",General Relativity
It is logical to ask what symmetries if any might apply in General Relativity,General Relativity
A tractable case might be to consider the symmetries of spacetime as seen by observers located far away from all sources of the gravitational field,General Relativity
"The naive expectation for asymptotically flat spacetime symmetries might be simply to extend and reproduce the symmetries of flat spacetime of special relativity, viz., the Poincaré group.
In 1962 Hermann Bondi, M",General Relativity
Sachs addressed this asymptotic symmetry problem in order to investigate the flow of energy at infinity due to propagating gravitational waves,General Relativity
"Their first step was to decide on some physically sensible boundary conditions to place on the gravitational field at light-like infinity to characterize what it means to say a metric is asymptotically flat, making no a priori assumptions about the nature of the asymptotic symmetry group—not even the assumption that such a group exists",General Relativity
"Then after designing what they considered to be the most sensible boundary conditions, they investigated the nature of the resulting asymptotic symmetry transformations that leave invariant the form of the boundary conditions appropriate for asymptotically flat gravitational fields",General Relativity
What they found was that the asymptotic symmetry transformations actually do form a group and the structure of this group does not depend on the particular gravitational field that happens to be present,General Relativity
"This means that, as expected, one can separate the kinematics of spacetime from the dynamics of the gravitational field at least at spatial infinity",General Relativity
"The puzzling surprise in 1962 was their discovery of a rich infinite-dimensional group (the so-called BMS group) as the asymptotic symmetry group, instead of the finite-dimensional Poincaré group, which is a subgroup of the BMS group",General Relativity
"Not only are the Lorentz transformations asymptotic symmetry transformations, there are also additional transformations that are not Lorentz transformations but are asymptotic symmetry transformations",General Relativity
"In fact, they found an additional infinity of transformation generators known as supertranslations",General Relativity
This implies the conclusion that General Relativity (GR) does not reduce to special relativity in the case of weak fields at long distances,General Relativity
"It turns out that the BMS symmetry, suitably modified, could be seen as a restatement of the universal soft graviton theorem in quantum field theory (QFT), which relates universal infrared (soft) QFT with GR asymptotic spacetime symmetries.


=== Causal structure and global geometry ===

In general relativity, no material body can catch up with or overtake a light pulse",General Relativity
No influence from an event A can reach any other location X before light sent out at A to X,General Relativity
"In consequence, an exploration of all light worldlines (null geodesics) yields key information about the spacetime's causal structure",General Relativity
"This structure can be displayed using Penrose–Carter diagrams in which infinitely large regions of space and infinite time intervals are shrunk (""compactified"") so as to fit onto a finite map, while light still travels along diagonals as in standard spacetime diagrams.
Aware of the importance of causal structure, Roger Penrose and others developed what is known as global geometry",General Relativity
"In global geometry, the object of study is not one particular solution (or family of solutions) to Einstein's equations",General Relativity
"Rather, relations that hold true for all geodesics, such as the Raychaudhuri equation, and additional non-specific assumptions about the nature of matter (usually in the form of energy conditions) are used to derive general results.


=== Horizons ===

Using global geometry, some spacetimes can be shown to contain boundaries called horizons, which demarcate one region from the rest of spacetime",General Relativity
"The best-known examples are black holes: if mass is compressed into a sufficiently compact region of space (as specified in the hoop conjecture, the relevant length scale is the Schwarzschild radius), no light from inside can escape to the outside",General Relativity
"Since no object can overtake a light pulse, all interior matter is imprisoned as well",General Relativity
"Passage from the exterior to the interior is still possible, showing that the boundary, the black hole's horizon, is not a physical barrier.

Early studies of black holes relied on explicit solutions of Einstein's equations, notably the spherically symmetric Schwarzschild solution (used to describe a static black hole) and the axisymmetric Kerr solution (used to describe a rotating, stationary black hole, and introducing interesting features such as the ergosphere)",General Relativity
"Using global geometry, later studies have revealed more general properties of black holes",General Relativity
"With time they become rather simple objects characterized by eleven parameters specifying: electric charge, mass–energy, linear momentum, angular momentum, and location at a specified time",General Relativity
"This is stated by the black hole uniqueness theorem: ""black holes have no hair"", that is, no distinguishing marks like the hairstyles of humans",General Relativity
"Irrespective of the complexity of a gravitating object collapsing to form a black hole, the object that results (having emitted gravitational waves) is very simple.
Even more remarkably, there is a general set of laws known as black hole mechanics, which is analogous to the laws of thermodynamics",General Relativity
"For instance, by the second law of black hole mechanics, the area of the event horizon of a general black hole will never decrease with time, analogous to the entropy of a thermodynamic system",General Relativity
This limits the energy that can be extracted by classical means from a rotating black hole (e.g,General Relativity
"There is strong evidence that the laws of black hole mechanics are, in fact, a subset of the laws of thermodynamics, and that the black hole area is proportional to its entropy",General Relativity
"This leads to a modification of the original laws of black hole mechanics: for instance, as the second law of black hole mechanics becomes part of the second law of thermodynamics, it is possible for the black hole area to decrease as long as other processes ensure that entropy increases overall",General Relativity
"As thermodynamical objects with nonzero temperature, black holes should emit thermal radiation",General Relativity
"Semiclassical calculations indicate that indeed they do, with the surface gravity playing the role of temperature in Planck's law",General Relativity
"the quantum theory section, below).
There are many other types of horizons",General Relativity
"In an expanding universe, an observer may find that some regions of the past cannot be observed (""particle horizon""), and some regions of the future cannot be influenced (event horizon)",General Relativity
"Even in flat Minkowski space, when described by an accelerated observer (Rindler space), there will be horizons associated with a semiclassical radiation known as Unruh radiation.


=== Singularities ===

Another general feature of general relativity is the appearance of spacetime boundaries known as singularities",General Relativity
Spacetime can be explored by following up on timelike and lightlike geodesics—all possible ways that light and particles in free fall can travel,General Relativity
"But some solutions of Einstein's equations have ""ragged edges""—regions known as spacetime singularities, where the paths of light and falling particles come to an abrupt end, and geometry becomes ill-defined",General Relativity
"In the more interesting cases, these are ""curvature singularities"", where geometrical quantities characterizing spacetime curvature, such as the Ricci scalar, take on infinite values",General Relativity
"Well-known examples of spacetimes with future singularities—where worldlines end—are the Schwarzschild solution, which describes a singularity inside an eternal static black hole, or the Kerr solution with its ring-shaped singularity inside an eternal rotating black hole",General Relativity
"The Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker solutions and other spacetimes describing universes have past singularities on which worldlines begin, namely Big Bang singularities, and some have future singularities (Big Crunch) as well.
Given that these examples are all highly symmetric—and thus simplified—it is tempting to conclude that the occurrence of singularities is an artifact of idealization",General Relativity
"The famous singularity theorems, proved using the methods of global geometry, say otherwise: singularities are a generic feature of general relativity, and unavoidable once the collapse of an object with realistic matter properties has proceeded beyond a certain stage and also at the beginning of a wide class of expanding universes",General Relativity
"However, the theorems say little about the properties of singularities, and much of current research is devoted to characterizing these entities' generic structure (hypothesized e.g",General Relativity
"The cosmic censorship hypothesis states that all realistic future singularities (no perfect symmetries, matter with realistic properties) are safely hidden away behind a horizon, and thus invisible to all distant observers",General Relativity
"While no formal proof yet exists, numerical simulations offer supporting evidence of its validity.


=== Evolution equations ===

Each solution of Einstein's equation encompasses the whole history of a universe—it is not just some snapshot of how things are, but a whole, possibly matter-filled, spacetime",General Relativity
It describes the state of matter and geometry everywhere and at every moment in that particular universe,General Relativity
"Due to its general covariance, Einstein's theory is not sufficient by itself to determine the time evolution of the metric tensor",General Relativity
"It must be combined with a coordinate condition, which is analogous to gauge fixing in other field theories.
To understand Einstein's equations as partial differential equations, it is helpful to formulate them in a way that describes the evolution of the universe over time",General Relativity
"This is done in ""3+1"" formulations, where spacetime is split into three space dimensions and one time dimension",General Relativity
"These decompositions show that the spacetime evolution equations of general relativity are well-behaved: solutions always exist, and are uniquely defined, once suitable initial conditions have been specified",General Relativity
"Such formulations of Einstein's field equations are the basis of numerical relativity.


=== Global and quasi-local quantities ===

The notion of evolution equations is intimately tied in with another aspect of general relativistic physics",General Relativity
"In Einstein's theory, it turns out to be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy)",General Relativity
"The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.
Nevertheless, there are possibilities to define a system's total mass, either using a hypothetical ""infinitely distant observer"" (ADM mass) or suitable symmetries (Komar mass)",General Relativity
"If one excludes from the system's total mass the energy being carried away to infinity by gravitational waves, the result is the Bondi mass at null infinity",General Relativity
"Just as in classical physics, it can be shown that these masses are positive",General Relativity
"There have also been a number of attempts to define quasi-local quantities, such as the mass of an isolated system formulated using only quantities defined within a finite region of space containing that system",General Relativity
"The hope is to obtain a quantity useful for general statements about isolated systems, such as a more precise formulation of the hoop conjecture.


== Relationship with quantum theory ==
If general relativity were considered to be one of the two pillars of modern physics, then quantum theory, the basis of understanding matter from elementary particles to solid-state physics, would be the other",General Relativity
"However, how to reconcile quantum theory with general relativity is still an open question.


=== Quantum field theory in curved spacetime ===

Ordinary quantum field theories, which form the basis of modern elementary particle physics, are defined in flat Minkowski space, which is an excellent approximation when it comes to describing the behavior of microscopic particles in weak gravitational fields like those found on Earth",General Relativity
"In order to describe situations in which gravity is strong enough to influence (quantum) matter, yet not strong enough to require quantization itself, physicists have formulated quantum field theories in curved spacetime",General Relativity
"These theories rely on general relativity to describe a curved background spacetime, and define a generalized quantum field theory to describe the behavior of quantum matter within that spacetime",General Relativity
"Using this formalism, it can be shown that black holes emit a blackbody spectrum of particles known as Hawking radiation leading to the possibility that they evaporate over time",General Relativity
"As briefly mentioned above, this radiation plays an important role for the thermodynamics of black holes.


=== Quantum gravity ===

The demand for consistency between a quantum description of matter and a geometric description of spacetime, as well as the appearance of singularities (where curvature length scales become microscopic), indicate the need for a full theory of quantum gravity: for an adequate description of the interior of black holes, and of the very early universe, a theory is required in which gravity and the associated geometry of spacetime are described in the language of quantum physics",General Relativity
"Despite major efforts, no complete and consistent theory of quantum gravity is currently known, even though a number of promising candidates exist.
Attempts to generalize ordinary quantum field theories, used in elementary particle physics to describe fundamental interactions, so as to include gravity have led to serious problems",General Relativity
"Some have argued that at low energies, this approach proves successful, in that it results in an acceptable effective (quantum) field theory of gravity",General Relativity
"At very high energies, however, the perturbative results are badly divergent and lead to models devoid of predictive power (""perturbative non-renormalizability"").

One attempt to overcome these limitations is string theory, a quantum theory not of point particles, but of minute one-dimensional extended objects",General Relativity
"The theory promises to be a unified description of all particles and interactions, including gravity; the price to pay is unusual features such as six extra dimensions of space in addition to the usual three",General Relativity
"In what is called the second superstring revolution, it was conjectured that both string theory and a unification of general relativity and supersymmetry known as supergravity form part of a hypothesized eleven-dimensional model known as M-theory, which would constitute a uniquely defined and consistent theory of quantum gravity.
Another approach starts with the canonical quantization procedures of quantum theory",General Relativity
"evolution equations above), the result is the Wheeler–deWitt equation (an analogue of the Schrödinger equation) which, regrettably, turns out to be ill-defined without a proper ultraviolet (lattice) cutoff",General Relativity
"However, with the introduction of what are now known as Ashtekar variables, this leads to a promising model known as loop quantum gravity",General Relativity
"Space is represented by a web-like structure called a spin network, evolving over time in discrete steps.
Depending on which features of general relativity and quantum theory are accepted unchanged, and on what level changes are introduced, there are numerous other attempts to arrive at a viable theory of quantum gravity, some examples being the lattice theory of gravity based on the Feynman Path Integral approach and Regge calculus, dynamical triangulations, causal sets, twistor models or the path integral based models of quantum cosmology.

All candidate theories still have major formal and conceptual problems to overcome",General Relativity
"They also face the common problem that, as yet, there is no way to put quantum gravity predictions to experimental tests (and thus to decide between the candidates where their predictions vary), although there is hope for this to change as future data from cosmological observations and particle physics experiments becomes available.


== Current status ==
General relativity has emerged as a highly successful model of gravitation and cosmology, which has so far passed many unambiguous observational and experimental tests",General Relativity
"However, there are strong indications that the theory is incomplete",General Relativity
The problem of quantum gravity and the question of the reality of spacetime singularities remain open,General Relativity
"Observational data that is taken as evidence for dark energy and dark matter could indicate the need for new physics.
Even taken as is, general relativity is rich with possibilities for further exploration",General Relativity
"Mathematical relativists seek to understand the nature of singularities and the fundamental properties of Einstein's equations, while numerical relativists run increasingly powerful computer simulations (such as those describing merging black holes)",General Relativity
"In February 2016, it was announced that the existence of gravitational waves was directly detected by the Advanced LIGO team on 14 September 2015",General Relativity
"A century after its introduction, general relativity remains a highly active area of research.

"Robotics is the interdisciplinary study and practice of the design, construction, operation, and use of robots.
Within mechanical engineering, robotics is the design and construction of the physical structures of robots, while in computer science, robotics focuses on robotic automation algorithms",Robotics
"Other disciplines contributing to robotics include electrical, control, software, information, electronic, telecommunication, computer, mechatronic, and materials engineering",Robotics
"

The goal of most robotics is to design machines that can help and assist humans",Robotics
"Many robots are built to do jobs that are hazardous to people, such as finding survivors in unstable ruins, and exploring space, mines and shipwrecks",Robotics
"Others replace people in jobs that are boring, repetitive, or unpleasant, such as cleaning, monitoring, transporting, and assembling",Robotics
"Today, robotics is a rapidly growing field, as technological advances continue; researching, designing, and building new robots serve various practical purposes.


== Robotics aspects ==

Robotics usually combines three aspects of design work to create robot systems:

Mechanical construction: a frame, form or shape designed to achieve a particular task",Robotics
"For example, a robot designed to travel across heavy dirt or mud might use caterpillar tracks",Robotics
Origami inspired robots can sense and analyze in extreme environments,Robotics
The mechanical aspect of the robot is mostly the creator's solution to completing the assigned task and dealing with the physics of the environment around it,Robotics
"Form follows function.
Electrical components that power and control the machinery",Robotics
"For example, the robot with caterpillar tracks would need some kind of power to move the tracker treads",Robotics
"That power comes in the form of electricity, which will have to travel through a wire and originate from a battery, a basic electrical circuit",Robotics
"Even petrol-powered machines that get their power mainly from petrol still require an electric current to start the combustion process which is why most petrol-powered machines like cars, have batteries",Robotics
"The electrical aspect of robots is used for movement (through motors), sensing (where electrical signals are used to measure things like heat, sound, position, and energy status), and operation (robots need some level of electrical energy supplied to their motors and sensors in order to activate and perform basic operations)
Software",Robotics
A program is how a robot decides when or how to do something,Robotics
"In the caterpillar track example, a robot that needs to move across a muddy road may have the correct mechanical construction and receive the correct amount of power from its battery, but would not be able to go anywhere without a program telling it to move",Robotics
"Programs are the core essence of a robot, it could have excellent mechanical and electrical construction, but if its program is poorly structured, its performance will be very poor (or it may not perform at all)",Robotics
"There are three different types of robotic programs: remote control, artificial intelligence, and hybrid",Robotics
"A robot with remote control programming has a preexisting set of commands that it will only perform if and when it receives a signal from a control source, typically a human being with remote control",Robotics
It is perhaps more appropriate to view devices controlled primarily by human commands as falling in the discipline of automation rather than robotics,Robotics
"Robots that use artificial intelligence interact with their environment on their own without a control source, and can determine reactions to objects and problems they encounter using their preexisting programming",Robotics
"A hybrid is a form of programming that incorporates both AI and RC functions in them.


== Applied robotics ==
As more and more robots are designed for specific tasks, this method of classification becomes more relevant",Robotics
"For example, many robots are designed for assembly work, which may not be readily adaptable for other applications",Robotics
"For seam welding, some suppliers provide complete welding systems with the robot i.e",Robotics
"the welding equipment along with other material handling facilities like turntables, etc",Robotics
"Such an integrated robotic system is called a ""welding robot"" even though its discrete manipulator unit could be adapted to a variety of tasks",Robotics
"Some robots are specifically designed for heavy load manipulation, and are labeled as ""heavy-duty robots"".
Current and potential applications include:

Manufacturing",Robotics
Robots have been increasingly used in manufacturing since the 1960s,Robotics
"According to the Robotic Industries Association US data, in 2016 the automotive industry was the main customer of industrial robots with 52% of total sales",Robotics
"In the auto industry, they can amount for more than half of the ""labor""",Robotics
"There are even ""lights off"" factories such as an IBM keyboard manufacturing factory in Texas that was fully automated as early as 2003.
Autonomous transport including airplane autopilot and self-driving cars
Domestic robots including robotic vacuum cleaners, robotic lawn mowers, dishwasher loading and flatbread baking.
Construction robots",Robotics
"Construction robots can be separated into three types: traditional robots, robotic arm, and robotic exoskeleton.
Automated mining.
Space exploration, including Mars rovers.
Energy applications including cleanup of nuclear contaminated areas; and cleaning solar panel arrays.
Medical robots and Robot-assisted surgery designed and used in clinics.
Agricultural robots",Robotics
"The use of robots in agriculture is closely linked to the concept of AI-assisted precision agriculture and drone usage.
Food processing",Robotics
"Commercial examples of kitchen automation are Flippy (burgers), Zume Pizza (pizza), Cafe X (coffee), Makr Shakr (cocktails), Frobot (frozen yogurts), Sally (salads), salad or food bowl robots manufactured by Dexai (a Draper Laboratory spinoff, operating on military bases), and integrated food bowl assembly systems manufactured by Spyce Kitchen (acquired by Sweetgreen) and Silicon Valley startup Hyphen",Robotics
"Other examples may include manufacturing technologies based on 3D Food Printing.
Military robots.
Robot sports for entertainment and education, including Robot combat, Autonomous racing, drone racing, and FIRST Robotics.


== Mechanical robotics areas ==


=== Power source ===

At present, mostly (lead–acid) batteries are used as a power source",Robotics
Many different types of batteries can be used as a power source for robots,Robotics
"They range from lead–acid batteries, which are safe and have relatively long shelf lives but are rather heavy compared to silver–cadmium batteries which are much smaller in volume and are currently much more expensive",Robotics
"Designing a battery-powered robot needs to take into account factors such as safety, cycle lifetime, and weight",Robotics
"Generators, often some type of internal combustion engine, can also be used",Robotics
"However, such designs are often mechanically complex and need fuel, require heat dissipation, and are relatively heavy",Robotics
A tether connecting the robot to a power supply would remove the power supply from the robot entirely,Robotics
This has the advantage of saving weight and space by moving all power generation and storage components elsewhere,Robotics
"However, this design does come with the drawback of constantly having a cable connected to the robot, which can be difficult to manage",Robotics
"
Potential power sources could be:

pneumatic (compressed gases)
Solar power (using the sun's energy and converting it into electrical power)
hydraulics (liquids)
flywheel energy storage
organic garbage (through anaerobic digestion)
nuclear


=== Actuation ===

Actuators are the ""muscles"" of a robot, the parts which convert stored energy into movement",Robotics
"By far the most popular actuators are electric motors that rotate a wheel or gear, and linear actuators that control industrial robots in factories",Robotics
"There are some recent advances in alternative types of actuators, powered by electricity, chemicals, or compressed air.


==== Electric motors ====

The vast majority of robots use electric motors, often brushed and brushless DC motors in portable robots or AC motors in industrial robots and CNC machines",Robotics
"These motors are often preferred in systems with lighter loads, and where the predominant form of motion is rotational.


==== Linear actuators ====

Various types of linear actuators move in and out instead of by spinning, and often have quicker direction changes, particularly when very large forces are needed such as with industrial robotics",Robotics
They are typically powered by compressed and oxidized air (pneumatic actuator) or an oil (hydraulic actuator) Linear actuators can also be powered by electricity which usually consists of a motor and a leadscrew,Robotics
"Another common type is a mechanical linear actuator such as a rack and pinion on a car.


==== Series elastic actuators ====
Series elastic actuation (SEA) relies on the idea of introducing intentional elasticity between the motor actuator and the load for robust force control",Robotics
"Due to the resultant lower reflected inertia, series elastic actuation improves safety when a robot interacts with the environment (e.g., humans or workpieces) or during collisions",Robotics
"Furthermore, it also provides energy efficiency and shock absorption (mechanical filtering) while reducing excessive wear on the transmission and other mechanical components",Robotics
"This approach has successfully been employed in various robots, particularly advanced manufacturing robots and walking humanoid robots.
The controller design of a series elastic actuator is most often performed within the passivity framework as it ensures the safety of interaction with unstructured environments",Robotics
"Despite its remarkable stability and robustness, this framework suffers from the stringent limitations imposed on the controller which may trade-off performance",Robotics
The reader is referred to the following survey which summarizes the common controller architectures for SEA along with the corresponding sufficient passivity conditions,Robotics
"One recent study has derived the necessary and sufficient passivity conditions for one of the most common impedance control architectures, namely velocity-sourced SEA",Robotics
"This work is of particular importance as it drives the non-conservative passivity bounds in an SEA scheme for the first time which allows a larger selection of control gains.


==== Air muscles ====

Pneumatic artificial muscles also known as air muscles, are special tubes that expand (typically up to 42%) when air is forced inside them",Robotics
"They are used in some robot applications.


==== Wire muscles ====

Muscle wire, also known as shape memory alloy, is a material that contracts (under 5%) when electricity is applied",Robotics
"They have been used for some small robot applications.


==== Electroactive polymers ====

EAPs or EPAMs are a plastic material that can contract substantially (up to 380% activation strain) from electricity, and have been used in facial muscles and arms of humanoid robots, and to enable new robots to float, fly, swim or walk.


==== Piezo motors ====

Recent alternatives to DC motors are piezo motors or ultrasonic motors",Robotics
"These work on a fundamentally different principle, whereby tiny piezoceramic elements, vibrating many thousands of times per second, cause linear or rotary motion",Robotics
There are different mechanisms of operation; one type uses the vibration of the piezo elements to step the motor in a circle or a straight line,Robotics
Another type uses the piezo elements to cause a nut to vibrate or to drive a screw,Robotics
"The advantages of these motors are nanometer resolution, speed, and available force for their size",Robotics
"These motors are already available commercially and being used on some robots.


==== Elastic nanotubes ====

Elastic nanotubes are a promising artificial muscle technology in early-stage experimental development",Robotics
"The absence of defects in carbon nanotubes enables these filaments to deform elastically by several percent, with energy storage levels of perhaps 10 J/cm3 for metal nanotubes",Robotics
Human biceps could be replaced with an 8 mm diameter wire of this material,Robotics
"Such compact ""muscle"" might allow future robots to outrun and outjump humans.


=== Sensing ===

Sensors allow robots to receive information about a certain measurement of the environment, or internal components",Robotics
"This is essential for robots to perform their tasks, and act upon any changes in the environment to calculate the appropriate response",Robotics
"They are used for various forms of measurements, to give the robots warnings about safety or malfunctions, and to provide real-time information about the task it is performing.


==== Touch ====

Current robotic and prosthetic hands receive far less tactile information than the human hand",Robotics
Recent research has developed a tactile sensor array that mimics the mechanical properties and touch receptors of human fingertips,Robotics
The sensor array is constructed as a rigid core surrounded by conductive fluid contained by an elastomeric skin,Robotics
Electrodes are mounted on the surface of the rigid core and are connected to an impedance-measuring device within the core,Robotics
"When the artificial skin touches an object the fluid path around the electrodes is deformed, producing impedance changes that map the forces received from the object",Robotics
"The researchers expect that an important function of such artificial fingertips will be adjusting the robotic grip on held objects.
Scientists from several European countries and Israel developed a prosthetic hand in 2009, called SmartHand, which functions like a real one —allowing patients to write with it, type on a keyboard, play piano, and perform other fine movements",Robotics
"The prosthesis has sensors which enable the patient to sense real feelings in its fingertips.


==== Other ====
Other common forms of sensing in robotics use lidar, radar, and sonar",Robotics
Lidar measures the distance to a target by illuminating the target with laser light and measuring the reflected light with a sensor,Robotics
"Radar uses radio waves to determine the range, angle, or velocity of objects",Robotics
"Sonar uses sound propagation to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or under the surface of the water.


==== Mechanical grippers ====
One of the most common types of end-effectors are ""grippers""",Robotics
"In its simplest manifestation, it consists of just two fingers that can open and close to pick up and let go of a range of small objects",Robotics
"Fingers can, for example, be made of a chain with a metal wire running through it",Robotics
Hands that resemble and work more like a human hand include the Shadow Hand and the Robonaut hand,Robotics
Hands that are of a mid-level complexity include the Delft hand,Robotics
"Mechanical grippers can come in various types, including friction and encompassing jaws",Robotics
Friction jaws use all the force of the gripper to hold the object in place using friction,Robotics
"Encompassing jaws cradle the object in place, using less friction.


==== Suction end-effectors ====
Suction end-effectors, powered by vacuum generators, are very simple astrictive devices that can hold very large loads provided the prehension surface is smooth enough to ensure suction.
Pick and place robots for electronic components and for large objects like car windscreens, often use very simple vacuum end-effectors.
Suction is a highly used type of end-effector in industry, in part because the natural compliance of soft suction end-effectors can enable a robot to be more robust in the presence of imperfect robotic perception",Robotics
As an example: consider the case of a robot vision system that estimates the position of a water bottle but has 1 centimeter of error,Robotics
"While this may cause a rigid mechanical gripper to puncture the water bottle, the soft suction end-effector may just bend slightly and conform to the shape of the water bottle surface.


==== General purpose effectors ====
Some advanced robots are beginning to use fully humanoid hands, like the Shadow Hand, MANUS, and the Schunk hand",Robotics
"They have powerful robot dexterity intelligence (RDI), with as many as 20 degrees of freedom and hundreds of tactile sensors.


== Control robotics areas ==

The mechanical structure of a robot must be controlled to perform tasks",Robotics
"The control of a robot involves three distinct phases – perception, processing, and action (robotic paradigms)",Robotics
Sensors give information about the environment or the robot itself (e.g,Robotics
"This information is then processed to be stored or transmitted and to calculate the appropriate signals to the actuators (motors), which move the mechanical structure to achieve the required co-ordinated motion or force actions.
The processing phase can range in complexity",Robotics
"At a reactive level, it may translate raw sensor information directly into actuator commands (e.g",Robotics
firing motor power electronic gates based directly upon encoder feedback signals to achieve the required torque/velocity of the shaft),Robotics
Sensor fusion and internal models may first be used to estimate parameters of interest (e.g,Robotics
the position of the robot's gripper) from noisy sensor data,Robotics
An immediate task (such as moving the gripper in a certain direction until an object is detected with a proximity sensor) is sometimes inferred from these estimates,Robotics
"Techniques from control theory are generally used to convert the higher-level tasks into individual commands that drive the actuators, most often using kinematic and dynamic models of the mechanical structure.
At longer time scales or with more sophisticated tasks, the robot may need to build and reason with a ""cognitive"" model",Robotics
"Cognitive models try to represent the robot, the world, and how the two interact",Robotics
Pattern recognition and computer vision can be used to track objects,Robotics
Mapping techniques can be used to build maps of the world,Robotics
"Finally, motion planning and other artificial intelligence techniques may be used to figure out how to act",Robotics
"For example, a planner may figure out how to achieve a task without hitting obstacles, falling over, etc.
Modern commercial robotic control systems are highly complex, integrate multiple sensors and effectors, have many interacting degrees-of-freedom (DOF) and require operator interfaces, programming tools and real-time capabilities",Robotics
They are oftentimes interconnected to wider communication networks and in many cases are now both IoT-enabled and mobile,Robotics
"Progress towards open architecture, layered, user-friendly and 'intelligent' sensor-based interconnected robots has emerged from earlier concepts related to Flexible Manufacturing Systems (FMS), and several 'open or 'hybrid' reference architectures exist which assist developers of robot control software and hardware to move beyond traditional, earlier notions of 'closed' robot control systems have been proposed",Robotics
"Open architecture controllers are said to be better able to meet the growing requirements of a wide range of robot users, including system developers, end users and research scientists, and are better positioned to deliver the advanced robotic concepts related to Industry 4.0",Robotics
"In addition to utilizing many established features of robot controllers, such as position, velocity and force control of end effectors, they also enable IoT interconnection and the implementation of more advanced sensor fusion and control techniques, including adaptive control, Fuzzy control and Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based control",Robotics
"When implemented in real-time, such techniques can potentially improve the stability and performance of robots operating in unknown or uncertain environments by enabling the control systems to learn and adapt to environmental changes",Robotics
"There are several examples of reference architectures for robot controllers, and also examples of successful implementations of actual robot controllers developed from them",Robotics
"One example of a generic reference architecture and associated interconnected, open-architecture robot and controller implementation was used in a number of research and development studies, including prototype implementation of novel advanced and intelligent control and environment mapping methods in real-time.


=== Manipulation ===

A definition of robotic manipulation has been provided by Matt Mason as: ""manipulation refers to an agent's control of its environment through selective contact"".
Robots need to manipulate objects; pick up, modify, destroy, move or otherwise have an effect",Robotics
"Thus the functional end of a robot arm intended to make the effect (whether a hand, or tool) are often referred to as end effectors, while the ""arm"" is referred to as a manipulator",Robotics
"Most robot arms have replaceable end-effectors, each allowing them to perform some small range of tasks",Robotics
"Some have a fixed manipulator that cannot be replaced, while a few have one very general-purpose manipulator, for example, a humanoid hand.


=== Locomotion ===


==== Rolling robots ====

For simplicity, most mobile robots have four wheels or a number of continuous tracks",Robotics
Some researchers have tried to create more complex wheeled robots with only one or two wheels,Robotics
"These can have certain advantages such as greater efficiency and reduced parts, as well as allowing a robot to navigate in confined places that a four-wheeled robot would not be able to.


===== Two-wheeled balancing robots =====
Balancing robots generally use a gyroscope to detect how much a robot is falling and then drive the wheels proportionally in the same direction, to counterbalance the fall at hundreds of times per second, based on the dynamics of an inverted pendulum",Robotics
"While the Segway is not commonly thought of as a robot, it can be thought of as a component of a robot, when used as such Segway refer to them as RMP (Robotic Mobility Platform)",Robotics
"An example of this use has been as NASA's Robonaut that has been mounted on a Segway.


===== One-wheeled balancing robots =====

A one-wheeled balancing robot is an extension of a two-wheeled balancing robot so that it can move in any 2D direction using a round ball as its only wheel",Robotics
"Several one-wheeled balancing robots have been designed recently, such as Carnegie Mellon University's ""Ballbot"" which is the approximate height and width of a person, and Tohoku Gakuin University's ""BallIP""",Robotics
"Because of the long, thin shape and ability to maneuver in tight spaces, they have the potential to function better than other robots in environments with people.


===== Spherical orb robots =====

Several attempts have been made in robots that are completely inside a spherical ball, either by spinning a weight inside the ball, or by rotating the outer shells of the sphere",Robotics
"These have also been referred to as an orb bot or a ball bot.


===== Six-wheeled robots =====
Using six wheels instead of four wheels can give better traction or grip in outdoor terrain such as on rocky dirt or grass.


===== Tracked robots =====
Tracks provide even more traction than a six-wheeled robot",Robotics
"Tracked wheels behave as if they were made of hundreds of wheels, therefore are very common for outdoor off-road robots, where the robot must drive on very rough terrain",Robotics
"However, they are difficult to use indoors such as on carpets and smooth floors",Robotics
"Examples include NASA's Urban Robot ""Urbie"".


==== Walking robots ====

Walking is a difficult and dynamic problem to solve",Robotics
"Several robots have been made which can walk reliably on two legs, however, none have yet been made which are as robust as a human",Robotics
"There has been much study on human-inspired walking, such as AMBER lab which was established in 2008 by the Mechanical Engineering Department at Texas A&M University",Robotics
"Many other robots have been built that walk on more than two legs, due to these robots being significantly easier to construct",Robotics
"Walking robots can be used for uneven terrains, which would provide better mobility and energy efficiency than other locomotion methods",Robotics
"Typically, robots on two legs can walk well on flat floors and can occasionally walk up stairs",Robotics
"Some of the methods which have been tried are:


===== ZMP technique =====

The zero moment point (ZMP) is the algorithm used by robots such as Honda's ASIMO",Robotics
"The robot's onboard computer tries to keep the total inertial forces (the combination of Earth's gravity and the acceleration and deceleration of walking), exactly opposed by the floor reaction force (the force of the floor pushing back on the robot's foot)",Robotics
"In this way, the two forces cancel out, leaving no moment (force causing the robot to rotate and fall over)",Robotics
"However, this is not exactly how a human walks, and the difference is obvious to human observers, some of whom have pointed out that ASIMO walks as if it needs the lavatory",Robotics
"ASIMO's walking algorithm is not static, and some dynamic balancing is used (see below)",Robotics
"However, it still requires a smooth surface to walk on.


===== Hopping =====
Several robots, built in the 1980s by Marc Raibert at the MIT Leg Laboratory, successfully demonstrated very dynamic walking",Robotics
"Initially, a robot with only one leg, and a very small foot could stay upright simply by hopping",Robotics
The movement is the same as that of a person on a pogo stick,Robotics
"As the robot falls to one side, it would jump slightly in that direction, in order to catch itself",Robotics
"Soon, the algorithm was generalised to two and four legs",Robotics
A bipedal robot was demonstrated running and even performing somersaults,Robotics
"A quadruped was also demonstrated which could trot, run, pace, and bound",Robotics
"For a full list of these robots, see the MIT Leg Lab Robots page.


===== Dynamic balancing (controlled falling) =====
A more advanced way for a robot to walk is by using a dynamic balancing algorithm, which is potentially more robust than the Zero Moment Point technique, as it constantly monitors the robot's motion, and places the feet in order to maintain stability",Robotics
"This technique was recently demonstrated by Anybots' Dexter Robot, which is so stable, it can even jump",Robotics
"Another example is the TU Delft Flame.


===== Passive dynamics =====

Perhaps the most promising approach uses passive dynamics where the momentum of swinging limbs is used for greater efficiency",Robotics
"It has been shown that totally unpowered humanoid mechanisms can walk down a gentle slope, using only gravity to propel themselves",Robotics
"Using this technique, a robot need only supply a small amount of motor power to walk along a flat surface or a little more to walk up a hill",Robotics
"This technique promises to make walking robots at least ten times more efficient than ZMP walkers, like ASIMO.


==== Flying ====
A modern passenger airliner is essentially a flying robot, with two humans to manage it",Robotics
"The autopilot can control the plane for each stage of the journey, including takeoff, normal flight, and even landing",Robotics
Other flying robots are uninhabited and are known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs),Robotics
"They can be smaller and lighter without a human pilot on board, and fly into dangerous territory for military surveillance missions",Robotics
"UAVs are also being developed which can fire on targets automatically, without the need for a command from a human",Robotics
"Other flying robots include cruise missiles, the Entomopter, and the Epson micro helicopter robot",Robotics
"Robots such as the Air Penguin, Air Ray, and Air Jelly have lighter-than-air bodies, are propelled by paddles, and are guided by sonar.


===== Biomimetic flying robots (BFRs) =====

BFRs take inspiration from flying mammals, birds, or insects",Robotics
"BFRs can have flapping wings, which generate the lift and thrust, or they can be propeller actuated",Robotics
"BFRs with flapping wings have increased stroke efficiencies, increased maneuverability, and reduced energy consumption in comparison to propeller actuated BFRs",Robotics
Mammal and bird inspired BFRs share similar flight characteristics and design considerations,Robotics
"For instance, both mammal and bird inspired BFRs minimize edge fluttering and pressure-induced wingtip curl by increasing the rigidity of the wing edge and wingtips",Robotics
"Mammal and insect inspired BFRs can be impact resistant, making them useful in cluttered environments.
Mammal inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from bats, but the flying squirrel has also inspired a prototype",Robotics
Examples of bat inspired BFRs include Bat Bot and the DALER,Robotics
"Mammal inspired BFRs can be designed to be multi-modal; therefore, they're capable of both flight and terrestrial movement",Robotics
"To reduce the impact of landing, shock absorbers can be implemented along the wings",Robotics
"Alternatively, the BFR can pitch up and increase the amount of drag it experiences",Robotics
"By increasing the drag force, the BFR will decelerate and minimize the impact upon grounding",Robotics
"Different land gait patterns can also be implemented.

Bird inspired BFRs can take inspiration from raptors, gulls, and everything in-between",Robotics
Bird inspired BFRs can be feathered to increase the angle of attack range over which the prototype can operate before stalling,Robotics
"The wings of bird inspired BFRs allow for in-plane deformation, and the in-plane wing deformation can be adjusted to maximize flight efficiency depending on the flight gait",Robotics
An example of a raptor inspired BFR is the prototype by Savastano et al,Robotics
"The prototype has fully deformable flapping wings and is capable of carrying a payload of up to 0.8 kg while performing a parabolic climb, steep descent, and rapid recovery",Robotics
"accurately mimics the elbow and wrist rotation of gulls, and they find that lift generation is maximized when the elbow and wrist deformations are opposite but equal.
Insect inspired BFRs typically take inspiration from beetles or dragonflies",Robotics
"An example of a beetle inspired BFR is the prototype by Phan and Park, and a dragonfly inspired BFR is the prototype by Hu et al",Robotics
The flapping frequency of insect inspired BFRs are much higher than those of other BFRs; this is because of the aerodynamics of insect flight,Robotics
"Insect inspired BFRs are much smaller than those inspired by mammals or birds, so they are more suitable for dense environments.


===== Biologically-inspired flying robots =====

A class of robots that are biologically inspired, but which do not attempt to mimic biology, are creations such as the Entomopter",Robotics
"Funded by DARPA, NASA, the United States Air Force, and the Georgia Tech Research Institute and patented by Prof",Robotics
"Michelson for covert terrestrial missions as well as flight in the lower Mars atmosphere, the Entomopter flight propulsion system uses low Reynolds number wings similar to those of the hawk moth (Manduca sexta), but flaps them in a non-traditional ""opposed x-wing fashion"" while ""blowing"" the surface to enhance lift based on the Coandă effect as well as to control vehicle attitude and direction",Robotics
"Waste gas from the propulsion system not only facilitates the blown wing aerodynamics, but also serves to create ultrasonic emissions like that of a Bat for obstacle avoidance",Robotics
"The Entomopter and other biologically-inspired robots leverage features of biological systems, but do not attempt to create mechanical analogs.


===== Snaking =====

Several snake robots have been successfully developed",Robotics
"Mimicking the way real snakes move, these robots can navigate very confined spaces, meaning they may one day be used to search for people trapped in collapsed buildings",Robotics
"The Japanese ACM-R5 snake robot can even navigate both on land and in water.


===== Skating =====
A small number of skating robots have been developed, one of which is a multi-mode walking and skating device",Robotics
"It has four legs, with unpowered wheels, which can either step or roll",Robotics
"Another robot, Plen, can use a miniature skateboard or roller-skates, and skate across a desktop.


===== Climbing =====
Several different approaches have been used to develop robots that have the ability to climb vertical surfaces",Robotics
One approach mimics the movements of a human climber on a wall with protrusions; adjusting the center of mass and moving each limb in turn to gain leverage,Robotics
"An example of this is Capuchin, built by Ruixiang Zhang at Stanford University, California",Robotics
"Another approach uses the specialized toe pad method of wall-climbing geckoes, which can run on smooth surfaces such as vertical glass",Robotics
"Examples of this approach include Wallbot and Stickybot.
China's Technology Daily reported on 15 November 2008, that Li Hiu Yeung and his research group of New Concept Aircraft (Zhuhai) Co., Ltd",Robotics
"had successfully developed a bionic gecko robot named ""Speedy Freelander""",Robotics
"According to Yeung, the gecko robot could rapidly climb up and down a variety of building walls, navigate through ground and wall fissures, and walk upside-down on the ceiling",Robotics
"It was also able to adapt to the surfaces of smooth glass, rough, sticky or dusty walls as well as various types of metallic materials",Robotics
Its flexibility and speed were comparable to a natural gecko,Robotics
"A third approach is to mimic the motion of a snake climbing a pole.


===== Swimming (Piscine) =====
It is calculated that when swimming some fish can achieve a propulsive efficiency greater than 90%",Robotics
"Furthermore, they can accelerate and maneuver far better than any man-made boat or submarine, and produce less noise and water disturbance",Robotics
"Therefore, many researchers studying underwater robots would like to copy this type of locomotion",Robotics
"Notable examples are the Robotic Fish G9, and Robot Tuna built to analyze and mathematically model thunniform motion",Robotics
"The Aqua Penguin, copies the streamlined shape and propulsion by front ""flippers"" of penguins",Robotics
"The Aqua Ray and Aqua Jelly emulate the locomotion of manta ray, and jellyfish, respectively.

In 2014, iSplash-II was developed as the first robotic fish capable of outperforming real carangiform fish in terms of average maximum velocity (measured in body lengths/ second) and endurance, the duration that top speed is maintained",Robotics
"The first build, iSplash-I (2014) was the first robotic platform to apply a full-body length carangiform swimming motion which was found to increase swimming speed by 27% over the traditional approach of a posterior confined waveform.


===== Sailing =====

Sailboat robots have also been developed in order to make measurements at the surface of the ocean",Robotics
"Since the propulsion of sailboat robots uses the wind, the energy of the batteries is only used for the computer, for the communication and for the actuators (to tune the rudder and the sail)",Robotics
"If the robot is equipped with solar panels, the robot could theoretically navigate forever",Robotics
"The two main competitions of sailboat robots are WRSC, which takes place every year in Europe, and Sailbot.


== Computational robotics areas ==

Control systems may also have varying levels of autonomy.

Direct interaction is used for haptic or teleoperated devices, and the human has nearly complete control over the robot's motion.
Operator-assist modes have the operator commanding medium-to-high-level tasks, with the robot automatically figuring out how to achieve them.
An autonomous robot may go without human interaction for extended periods of time ",Robotics
Higher levels of autonomy do not necessarily require more complex cognitive capabilities,Robotics
"For example, robots in assembly plants are completely autonomous but operate in a fixed pattern.
Another classification takes into account the interaction between human control and the machine motions.

Teleoperation",Robotics
"A human controls each movement, each machine actuator change is specified by the operator.
Supervisory",Robotics
"A human specifies general moves or position changes and the machine decides specific movements of its actuators.
Task-level autonomy",Robotics
"The operator specifies only the task and the robot manages itself to complete it.
Full autonomy",Robotics
"The machine will create and complete all its tasks without human interaction.


=== Vision ===

Computer vision is the science and technology of machines that see",Robotics
"As a scientific discipline, computer vision is concerned with the theory behind artificial systems that extract information from images",Robotics
"The image data can take many forms, such as video sequences and views from cameras.
In most practical computer vision applications, the computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common.
Computer vision systems rely on image sensors that detect electromagnetic radiation which is typically in the form of either visible light or infra-red light",Robotics
The process by which light propagates and reflects off surfaces is explained using optics,Robotics
Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process,Robotics
Robots can also be equipped with multiple vision sensors to be better able to compute the sense of depth in the environment,Robotics
"Like human eyes, robots' ""eyes"" must also be able to focus on a particular area of interest, and also adjust to variations in light intensities.
There is a subfield within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological system, at different levels of complexity",Robotics
"Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision have a background in biology.


=== Environmental interaction and navigation ===

Though a significant percentage of robots in commission today are either human controlled or operate in a static environment, there is an increasing interest in robots that can operate autonomously in a dynamic environment",Robotics
These robots require some combination of navigation hardware and software in order to traverse their environment,Robotics
people and other obstacles that are not stationary) can cause problems or collisions,Robotics
Some highly advanced robots such as ASIMO and Meinü robot have particularly good robot navigation hardware and software,Robotics
"Also, self-controlled cars, Ernst Dickmanns' driverless car, and the entries in the DARPA Grand Challenge, are capable of sensing the environment well and subsequently making navigational decisions based on this information, including by a swarm of autonomous robots",Robotics
"Most of these robots employ a GPS navigation device with waypoints, along with radar, sometimes combined with other sensory data such as lidar, video cameras, and inertial guidance systems for better navigation between waypoints.


=== Human-robot interaction ===

The state of the art in sensory intelligence for robots will have to progress through several orders of magnitude if we want the robots working in our homes to go beyond vacuum-cleaning the floors",Robotics
"If robots are to work effectively in homes and other non-industrial environments, the way they are instructed to perform their jobs, and especially how they will be told to stop will be of critical importance",Robotics
"The people who interact with them may have little or no training in robotics, and so any interface will need to be extremely intuitive",Robotics
"Science fiction authors also typically assume that robots will eventually be capable of communicating with humans through speech, gestures, and facial expressions, rather than a command-line interface",Robotics
"Although speech would be the most natural way for the human to communicate, it is unnatural for the robot",Robotics
"It will probably be a long time before robots interact as naturally as the fictional C-3PO, or Data of Star Trek, Next Generation",Robotics
"Even though the current state of robotics cannot meet the standards of these robots from science-fiction, robotic media characters (e.g., Wall-E, R2-D2) can elicit audience sympathies that increase people's willingness to accept actual robots in the future",Robotics
Acceptance of social robots is also likely to increase if people can meet a social robot under appropriate conditions,Robotics
"Studies have shown that interacting with a robot by looking at, touching, or even imagining interacting with the robot can reduce negative feelings that some people have about robots before interacting with them",Robotics
"However, if pre-existing negative sentiments are especially strong, interacting with a robot can increase those negative feelings towards robots.


==== Speech recognition ====

Interpreting the continuous flow of sounds coming from a human, in real time, is a difficult task for a computer, mostly because of the great variability of speech",Robotics
"The same word, spoken by the same person may sound different depending on local acoustics, volume, the previous word, whether or not the speaker has a cold, etc.",Robotics
It becomes even harder when the speaker has a different accent,Robotics
"Nevertheless, great strides have been made in the field since Davis, Biddulph, and Balashek designed the first ""voice input system"" which recognized ""ten digits spoken by a single user with 100% accuracy"" in 1952",Robotics
"Currently, the best systems can recognize continuous, natural speech, up to 160 words per minute, with an accuracy of 95%",Robotics
"With the help of artificial intelligence, machines nowadays can use people's voice to identify their emotions such as satisfied or angry.


==== Robotic voice ====
Other hurdles exist when allowing the robot to use voice for interacting with humans",Robotics
"For social reasons, synthetic voice proves suboptimal as a communication medium, making it necessary to develop the emotional component of robotic voice through various techniques",Robotics
"An advantage of diphonic branching is the emotion that the robot is programmed to project, can be carried on the voice tape, or phoneme, already pre-programmed onto the voice media",Robotics
One of the earliest examples is a teaching robot named Leachim developed in 1974 by Michael J,Robotics
Leachim was able to convert digital memory to rudimentary verbal speech on pre-recorded computer discs,Robotics
"It was programmed to teach students in The Bronx, New York.


==== Facial expression ====

Facial expressions can provide rapid feedback on the progress of a dialog between two humans, and soon may be able to do the same for humans and robots",Robotics
"Robotic faces have been constructed by Hanson Robotics using their elastic polymer called Frubber, allowing a large number of facial expressions due to the elasticity of the rubber facial coating and embedded subsurface motors (servos)",Robotics
The coating and servos are built on a metal skull,Robotics
"A robot should know how to approach a human, judging by their facial expression and body language",Robotics
"Whether the person is happy, frightened, or crazy-looking affects the type of interaction expected of the robot",Robotics
"Likewise, robots like Kismet and the more recent addition, Nexi can produce a range of facial expressions, allowing it to have meaningful social exchanges with humans.


==== Gestures ====

One can imagine, in the future, explaining to a robot chef how to make a pastry, or asking directions from a robot police officer",Robotics
"In both of these cases, making hand gestures would aid the verbal descriptions",Robotics
"In the first case, the robot would be recognizing gestures made by the human, and perhaps repeating them for confirmation",Robotics
"In the second case, the robot police officer would gesture to indicate ""down the road, then turn right""",Robotics
It is likely that gestures will make up a part of the interaction between humans and robots,Robotics
"A great many systems have been developed to recognize human hand gestures.


==== Proxemics ====
Proxemics is the study of personal space, and HRI systems may try to model and work with its concepts for human interactions.


==== Artificial emotions ====
Artificial emotions can also be generated, composed of a sequence of facial expressions or gestures",Robotics
"As can be seen from the movie Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within, the programming of these artificial emotions is complex and requires a large amount of human observation",Robotics
"To simplify this programming in the movie, presets were created together with a special software program",Robotics
This decreased the amount of time needed to make the film,Robotics
These presets could possibly be transferred for use in real-life robots,Robotics
"An example of a robot with artificial emotions is Robin the Robot developed by an Armenian IT company Expper Technologies, which uses AI-based peer-to-peer interaction",Robotics
Robin was trained to analyze facial expressions and use his face to display his emotions given the context,Robotics
"The robot has been tested by kids in US clinics, and observations show that Robin increased the appetite and cheerfulness of children after meeting and talking.


==== Personality ====
Many of the robots of science fiction have a personality, something which may or may not be desirable in the commercial robots of the future",Robotics
"Nevertheless, researchers are trying to create robots which appear to have a personality: i.e",Robotics
"they use sounds, facial expressions, and body language to try to convey an internal state, which may be joy, sadness, or fear",Robotics
"One commercial example is Pleo, a toy robot dinosaur, which can exhibit several apparent emotions.


== Research robotics ==

Much of the research in robotics focuses not on specific industrial tasks, but on investigations into new types of robots, alternative ways to think about or design robots, and new ways to manufacture them",Robotics
"Other investigations, such as MIT's cyberflora project, are almost wholly academic.
To describe the level of advancement of a robot, the term ""Generation Robots"" can be used",Robotics
"This term is coined by Professor Hans Moravec, Principal Research Scientist at the Carnegie Mellon University Robotics Institute in describing the near future evolution of robot technology",Robotics
"First-generation robots, Moravec predicted in 1997, should have an intellectual capacity comparable to perhaps a lizard and should become available by 2010",Robotics
"Because the first generation robot would be incapable of learning, however, Moravec predicts that the second generation robot would be an improvement over the first and become available by 2020, with the intelligence maybe comparable to that of a mouse",Robotics
The third generation robot should have intelligence comparable to that of a monkey,Robotics
"Though fourth generation robots, robots with human intelligence, professor Moravec predicts, would become possible, he does not predict this happening before around 2040 or 2050.


=== Dynamics and kinematics ===

The study of motion can be divided into kinematics and dynamics",Robotics
"Direct kinematics or forward kinematics refers to the calculation of end effector position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known",Robotics
"Inverse kinematics refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning",Robotics
"Some special aspects of kinematics include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance",Robotics
"Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using kinematics, methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements",Robotics
Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known,Robotics
Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot,Robotics
Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration,Robotics
"This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.
In each area mentioned above, researchers strive to develop new concepts and strategies, improve existing ones, and improve the interaction between these areas",Robotics
"To do this, criteria for ""optimal"" performance and ways to optimize design, structure, and control of robots must be developed and implemented.


=== Open source robotics ===

Open source robotics research seeks standards for defining, and methods for designing and building, robots so that they can easily be reproduced by anyone",Robotics
Research includes legal and technical definitions; seeking out alternative tools and materials to reduce costs and simplify builds; and creating interfaces and standards for designs to work together,Robotics
"Human usability research also investigates how to best document builds through visual, text or video instructions.


=== Evolutionary robotics ===
Evolutionary robots is a methodology that uses evolutionary computation to help design robots, especially the body form, or motion and behavior controllers",Robotics
"In a similar way to natural evolution, a large population of robots is allowed to compete in some way, or their ability to perform a task is measured using a fitness function",Robotics
"Those that perform worst are removed from the population and replaced by a new set, which have new behaviors based on those of the winners",Robotics
"Over time the population improves, and eventually a satisfactory robot may appear",Robotics
This happens without any direct programming of the robots by the researchers,Robotics
"Researchers use this method both to create better robots, and to explore the nature of evolution",Robotics
"Because the process often requires many generations of robots to be simulated, this technique may be run entirely or mostly in simulation, using a robot simulator software package, then tested on real robots once the evolved algorithms are good enough",Robotics
"Currently, there are about 10 million industrial robots toiling around the world, and Japan is the top country having high density of utilizing robots in its manufacturing industry.


=== Bionics and biomimetics ===
Bionics and biomimetics apply the physiology and methods of locomotion of animals to the design of robots",Robotics
"For example, the design of BionicKangaroo was based on the way kangaroos jump.


=== Swarm robotics ===
Swarm robotics is an approach to the coordination of multiple robots as a system which consist of large numbers of mostly simple physical robots",Robotics
"″In a robot swarm, the collective behavior of the robots results from local interactions between the robots and between the robots and the environment in which they act.″* 


=== Quantum computing ===
There has been some research into whether robotics algorithms can be run more quickly on quantum computers than they can be run on digital computers",Robotics
"This area has been referred to as quantum robotics.


=== Other research areas ===
Nanorobots.
Cobots (collaborative robots).
Autonomous drones.
High temperature crucibles allow robotic systems to automate sample analysis.
The main venues for robotics research are the international conferences ICRA and IROS.


== Human factors ==


=== Education and training ===

Robotics engineers design robots, maintain them, develop new applications for them, and conduct research to expand the potential of robotics",Robotics
"Robots have become a popular educational tool in some middle and high schools, particularly in parts of the USA, as well as in numerous youth summer camps, raising interest in programming, artificial intelligence, and robotics among students.


=== Employment ===

Robotics is an essential component in many modern manufacturing environments",Robotics
"As factories increase their use of robots, the number of robotics–related jobs grow and have been observed to be steadily rising",Robotics
The employment of robots in industries has increased productivity and efficiency savings and is typically seen as a long-term investment for benefactors,Robotics
"A study found that 47 percent of US jobs are at risk to automation ""over some unspecified number of years""",Robotics
"These claims have been criticized on the ground that social policy, not AI, causes unemployment",Robotics
"In a 2016 article in The Guardian, Stephen Hawking stated ""The automation of factories has already decimated jobs in traditional manufacturing, and the rise of artificial intelligence is likely to extend this job destruction deep into the middle classes, with only the most caring, creative or supervisory roles remaining""",Robotics
"  The rise of robotics is thus often used as an argument for universal basic income.
According to a GlobalData September 2021 report, the robotics industry was worth $45bn in 2020, and by 2030, it will have grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 29% to $568bn, driving jobs in robotics and related industries.


=== Occupational safety and health implications ===

A discussion paper drawn up by EU-OSHA highlights how the spread of robotics presents both opportunities and challenges for occupational safety and health (OSH).
The greatest OSH benefits stemming from the wider use of robotics should be substitution for people working in unhealthy or dangerous environments",Robotics
"In space, defense, security, or the nuclear industry, but also in logistics, maintenance, and inspection, autonomous robots are particularly useful in replacing human workers performing dirty, dull or unsafe tasks, thus avoiding workers' exposures to hazardous agents and conditions and reducing physical, ergonomic and psychosocial risks",Robotics
"For example, robots are already used to perform repetitive and monotonous tasks, to handle radioactive material or to work in explosive atmospheres",Robotics
"In the future, many other highly repetitive, risky or unpleasant tasks will be performed by robots in a variety of sectors like agriculture, construction, transport, healthcare, firefighting or cleaning services.
Moreover, there are certain skills to which humans will be better suited than machines for some time to come and the question is how to achieve the best combination of human and robot skills",Robotics
"The advantages of robotics include heavy-duty jobs with precision and repeatability, whereas the advantages of humans include creativity, decision-making, flexibility, and adaptability",Robotics
"This need to combine optimal skills has resulted in collaborative robots and humans sharing a common workspace more closely and led to the development of new approaches and standards to guarantee the safety of the ""man-robot merger""",Robotics
Some European countries are including robotics in their national programs and trying to promote a safe and flexible cooperation between robots and operators to achieve better productivity,Robotics
"For example, the German Federal Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (BAuA) organises annual workshops on the topic ""human-robot collaboration"".
In the future, cooperation between robots and humans will be diversified, with robots increasing their autonomy and human-robot collaboration reaching completely new forms",Robotics
"Current approaches and technical standards aiming to protect employees from the risk of working with collaborative robots will have to be revised.


=== User experience ===
Great user experience predicts the needs, experiences, behaviors, language and cognitive abilities, and other factors of each user group",Robotics
It then uses these insights to produce a product or solution that is ultimately useful and usable,Robotics
"For robots, user experience begins with an understanding of the robot's intended task and environment, while considering any possible social impact the robot may have on human operations and interactions with it.
It defines that communication as the transmission of information through signals, which are elements perceived through touch, sound, smell and sight",Robotics
"The author states that the signal connects the sender to the receiver and consists of three parts: the signal itself, what it refers to, and the interpreter",Robotics
"Body postures and gestures, facial expressions, hand and head movements are all part of nonverbal behavior and communication",Robotics
Robots are no exception when it comes to human-robot interaction,Robotics
"Therefore, humans use their verbal and nonverbal behaviors to communicate their defining characteristics",Robotics
"Similarly, social robots need this coordination to perform human-like behaviors.


== Careers ==
Robotics is an interdisciplinary field, combining primarily mechanical engineering and computer science but also drawing on electronic engineering and other subjects",Robotics
"The usual way to build a career in robotics is to complete an undergraduate degree in one of these established subjects, followed by a graduate (masters') degree in Robotics",Robotics
"Graduate degrees are typically joined by students coming from all of the contributing disciplines, and include familiarization of relevant undergraduate level subject matter from each of them, followed by specialist study in pure robotics topics which build upon them",Robotics
"As an interdisciplinary subject, robotics graduate programmes tend to be especially reliant on students working and learning together and sharing their knowledge and skills from their home discipline first degrees",Robotics
"   
Robotics industry careers then follow the same pattern, with most roboticists working as part of interdisciplinary teams of specialists from these home disciplines followed by the robotics graduate degrees which enable them to work together",Robotics
"Workers typically continue to identify as members of their home disciplines who work in robotics, rather than as 'roboticists'",Robotics
"This structure is reinforced by the nature of some engineering professions, which grant chartered engineer status to members of home disciplines rather than to robotics as a whole.
Robotics careers are widely predicted to grow in the 21st century, as robots replace more manual and intellectual human work",Robotics
"Some workers who lose their jobs to robotics may be well-placed to retrain to build and maintain these robots, using their domain-specific knowledge and skills.

A quantum computer is a computer that exploits quantum mechanical phenomena,Quantum Computing
"On small scales, physical matter exhibits properties of both particles and waves, and quantum computing leverages this behavior using specialized hardware",Quantum Computing
"Classical physics cannot explain the operation of these quantum devices, and a scalable quantum computer could perform some calculations exponentially faster than any modern ""classical"" computer",Quantum Computing
"In particular, a large-scale quantum computer could break widely used encryption schemes and aid physicists in performing physical simulations; however, the current state of the art is largely experimental and impractical, with several obstacles to useful applications.
The basic unit of information in quantum computing, the qubit (or ""quantum bit""), serves the same function as the bit in classical computing",Quantum Computing
"However, unlike a classical bit, which can be in one of two states (a binary), a qubit can exist in a superposition of its two ""basis"" states, which loosely means that it is in both states simultaneously",Quantum Computing

== History ==

For many years, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science formed distinct academic communities",Quantum Computing
"Modern quantum theory developed in the 1920s to explain the wave–particle duality observed at atomic scales, and digital computers emerged in the following decades to replace human computers for tedious calculations",Quantum Computing
"Both disciplines had practical applications during World War II; computers played a major role in wartime cryptography, and quantum physics was essential for the nuclear physics used in the Manhattan Project.
As physicists applied quantum mechanical models to computational problems and swapped digital bits for qubits, the fields of quantum mechanics and computer science began to converge.
In 1980, Paul Benioff introduced the quantum Turing machine, which uses quantum theory to describe a simplified computer.
When digital computers became faster, physicists faced an exponential increase in overhead when simulating quantum dynamics, prompting Yuri Manin and Richard Feynman to independently suggest that hardware based on quantum phenomena might be more efficient for computer simulation.
In a 1984 paper, Charles Bennett and Gilles Brassard applied quantum theory to cryptography protocols and demonstrated that quantum key distribution could enhance information security.
Quantum algorithms then emerged for solving oracle problems, such as Deutsch's algorithm in 1985, the Bernstein–Vazirani algorithm in 1993, and Simon's algorithm in 1994.
These algorithms did not solve practical problems, but demonstrated mathematically that one could gain more information by querying a black box with a quantum state in superposition, sometimes referred to as quantum parallelism.

Peter Shor built on these results with his 1994 algorithm for breaking the widely used RSA and Diffie–Hellman encryption protocols, which drew significant attention to the field of quantum computing.
In 1996, Grover's algorithm established a quantum speedup for the widely applicable unstructured search problem",Quantum Computing
"The same year, Seth Lloyd proved that quantum computers could simulate quantum systems without the exponential overhead present in classical simulations, validating Feynman's 1982 conjecture.
Over the years, experimentalists have constructed small-scale quantum computers using trapped ions and superconductors.
In 1998, a two-qubit quantum computer demonstrated the feasibility of the technology, and subsequent experiments have increased the number of qubits and reduced error rates.
In 2019, Google AI and NASA announced that they had achieved quantum supremacy with a 54-qubit machine, performing a computation that is impossible for any classical computer",Quantum Computing
"However, the validity of this claim is still being actively researched.
The threshold theorem shows how increasing the number of qubits can mitigate errors, yet fully fault-tolerant quantum computing remains ""a rather distant dream""",Quantum Computing
"According to some researchers, noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) machines may have specialized uses in the near future, but noise in quantum gates limits their reliability.
Investment in quantum computing research has increased in the public and private sectors.
As one consulting firm summarized,

..",Quantum Computing
"investment dollars are pouring in, and quantum-computing start-ups are proliferating",Quantum Computing
"While quantum computing promises to help businesses solve problems that are beyond the reach and speed of conventional high-performance computers, use cases are largely experimental and hypothetical at this early stage.
With focus on business management’s point of view, the potential applications of quantum computing into four major categories are cybersecurity, data analytics and artificial intelligence, optimization and simulation, and data management and searching.
In December 2023, physicists, for the first time, reported the entanglement of individual molecules, which may have significant applications in quantum computing",Quantum Computing
"Also in December 2023, scientists at Harvard University successfully created ""quantum circuits"" that correct errors more efficiently than alternative methods, which may potentially remove a major obstacle to practical quantum computers",Quantum Computing
"The Harvard research team was supported by MIT, QuEra Computing, Caltech, and Princeton University and funded by DARPA's Optimization with Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum devices (ONISQ) program",Quantum Computing
"Research efforts are ongoing to jumpstart quantum computing through topological and photonic approaches as well.


== Quantum information processing ==

Computer engineers typically describe a modern computer's operation in terms of classical electrodynamics.
Within these ""classical"" computers, some components (such as semiconductors and random number generators) may rely on quantum behavior, but these components are not isolated from their environment, so any quantum information quickly decoheres.
While programmers may depend on probability theory when designing a randomized algorithm, quantum mechanical notions like superposition and interference are largely irrelevant for program analysis.
Quantum programs, in contrast, rely on precise control of coherent quantum systems",Quantum Computing
"Complex numbers model probability amplitudes, vectors model quantum states, and matrices model the operations that can be performed on these states",Quantum Computing
"Programming a quantum computer is then a matter of composing operations in such a way that the resulting program computes a useful result in theory and is implementable in practice.
As physicist Charlie Bennett describes the relationship between quantum and classical computers,

A classical computer is a quantum computer ..",Quantum Computing
"so we shouldn't be asking about ""where do quantum speedups come from?"" We should say, ""well, all computers are quantum",Quantum Computing
"Where do classical slowdowns come from?""

 with equal probability.
Each additional qubit doubles the dimension of the state space.
As an example, the vector ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|01⟩ represents a two-qubit state, a tensor product of the qubit |0⟩ with the qubit ⁠1/√2⁠|0⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|1⟩.
This vector inhabits a four-dimensional vector space spanned by the basis vectors |00⟩, |01⟩, |10⟩, and |11⟩.
The Bell state ⁠1/√2⁠|00⟩ + ⁠1/√2⁠|11⟩ is impossible to decompose into the tensor product of two individual qubits—the two qubits are entangled because their probability amplitudes are correlated.
In general, the vector space for an n-qubit system is 2n-dimensional, and this makes it challenging for a classical computer to simulate a quantum one: representing a 100-qubit system requires storing 2100 classical values.

In summary, quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements",Quantum Computing
"However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.


=== Quantum parallelism ===
Quantum parallelism is the heuristic that quantum computers can be thought of as evaluating a function for multiple input values simultaneously",Quantum Computing
"This can be achieved by preparing a quantum system in a superposition of input states, and applying a unitary transformation that encodes the function to be evaluated",Quantum Computing
"The resulting state encodes the function's output values for all input values in the superposition, allowing for the computation of multiple outputs simultaneously",Quantum Computing
This property is key to the speedup of many quantum algorithms,Quantum Computing
"However, ""parallelism"" in this sense is insufficient to speed up a computation, because the measurement at the end of the computation gives only one value",Quantum Computing
"To be useful, a quantum algorithm must also incorporate some other conceptual ingredient.


=== Quantum programming ===

There are a number of models of computation for quantum computing, distinguished by the basic elements in which the computation is decomposed.


==== Gate array ====

A quantum gate array decomposes computation into a sequence of few-qubit quantum gates",Quantum Computing
A quantum computation can be described as a network of quantum logic gates and measurements,Quantum Computing
"However, any measurement can be deferred to the end of quantum computation, though this deferment may come at a computational cost, so most quantum circuits depict a network consisting only of quantum logic gates and no measurements.
Any quantum computation (which is, in the above formalism, any unitary matrix of size 
  
    
      
        
          2
          
            n
          
        
        ×
        
          2
          
            n
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle 2^{n}\times 2^{n}}
  
 over 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 qubits) can be represented as a network of quantum logic gates from a fairly small family of gates",Quantum Computing
"A choice of gate family that enables this construction is known as a universal gate set, since a computer that can run such circuits is a universal quantum computer",Quantum Computing
One common such set includes all single-qubit gates as well as the CNOT gate from above,Quantum Computing
This means any quantum computation can be performed by executing a sequence of single-qubit gates together with CNOT gates,Quantum Computing
"Though this gate set is infinite, it can be replaced with a finite gate set by appealing to the Solovay-Kitaev theorem",Quantum Computing
Implementation of Boolean functions using the few-qubit quantum gates is presented here,Quantum Computing
"


==== Measurement-based quantum computing ====
A measurement-based quantum computer decomposes computation into a sequence of Bell state measurements and single-qubit quantum gates applied to a highly entangled initial state (a cluster state), using a technique called quantum gate teleportation.


==== Adiabatic quantum computing ====
An adiabatic quantum computer, based on quantum annealing, decomposes computation into a slow continuous transformation of an initial Hamiltonian into a final Hamiltonian, whose ground states contain the solution.


==== Neuromorphic quantum computing ====
Neuromorphic quantum computing (abbreviated as ‘n.quantum computing’) is an unconventional computing type of computing that uses neuromorphic computing to perform quantum operations",Quantum Computing
"It was suggested that quantum algorithms, which are algorithms that run on a realistic model of quantum computation, can be computed equally efficiently with neuromorphic quantum computing",Quantum Computing
"Both, traditional quantum computing and neuromorphic quantum computing are physics-based unconventional computing approaches to computations and don’t follow the von Neumann architecture",Quantum Computing
"They both construct a system (a circuit) that represents the physical problem at hand, and then leverage their respective physics properties of the system to seek the “minimum”",Quantum Computing
"Neuromorphic quantum computing and quantum computing share similar physical properties during computation.


==== Topological quantum computing ====
A topological quantum computer decomposes computation into the braiding of anyons in a 2D lattice.


==== Quantum Turing machine ====
A quantum Turing machine is the quantum analog of a Turing machine",Quantum Computing
"All of these models of computation—quantum circuits, one-way quantum computation, adiabatic quantum computation, and topological quantum computation—have been shown to be equivalent to the quantum Turing machine; given a perfect implementation of one such quantum computer, it can simulate all the others with no more than polynomial overhead",Quantum Computing
"This equivalence need not hold for practical quantum computers, since the overhead of simulation may be too large to be practical.


=== Quantum cryptography and cybersecurity ===

Quantum computing has significant potential applications in the fields of cryptography and cybersecurity",Quantum Computing
"Quantum cryptography, which relies on the principles of quantum mechanics, offers the possibility of secure communication channels that are resistant to eavesdropping",Quantum Computing
"Quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols, such as BB84, enable the secure exchange of cryptographic keys between parties, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of communication",Quantum Computing
"Moreover, quantum random number generators (QRNGs) can produce high-quality random numbers, which are essential for secure encryption.
However, quantum computing also poses challenges to traditional cryptographic systems",Quantum Computing
"Shor's algorithm, a quantum algorithm for integer factorization, could potentially break widely used public-key cryptography schemes like RSA, which rely on the difficulty of factoring large numbers",Quantum Computing
"Post-quantum cryptography, which involves the development of cryptographic algorithms that are resistant to attacks by both classical and quantum computers, is an active area of research aimed at addressing this concern.
Ongoing research in quantum cryptography and post-quantum cryptography is crucial for ensuring the security of communication and data in the face of evolving quantum computing capabilities",Quantum Computing
"Advances in these fields, such as the development of new QKD protocols, the improvement of QRNGs, and the standardization of post-quantum cryptographic algorithms, will play a key role in maintaining the integrity and confidentiality of information in the quantum era.


== Communication ==

Quantum cryptography enables new ways to transmit data securely; for example, quantum key distribution uses entangled quantum states to establish secure cryptographic keys",Quantum Computing
"When a sender and receiver exchange quantum states, they can guarantee that an adversary does not intercept the message, as any unauthorized eavesdropper would disturb the delicate quantum system and introduce a detectable change",Quantum Computing
"With appropriate cryptographic protocols, the sender and receiver can thus establish shared private information resistant to eavesdropping.
Modern fiber-optic cables can transmit quantum information over relatively short distances",Quantum Computing
"Ongoing experimental research aims to develop more reliable hardware (such as quantum repeaters), hoping to scale this technology to long-distance quantum networks with end-to-end entanglement",Quantum Computing
"Theoretically, this could enable novel technological applications, such as distributed quantum computing and enhanced quantum sensing.


== Algorithms ==
Progress in finding quantum algorithms typically focuses on this quantum circuit model, though exceptions like the quantum adiabatic algorithm exist",Quantum Computing
"Quantum algorithms can be roughly categorized by the type of speedup achieved over corresponding classical algorithms.
Quantum algorithms that offer more than a polynomial speedup over the best-known classical algorithm include Shor's algorithm for factoring and the related quantum algorithms for computing discrete logarithms, solving Pell's equation, and more generally solving the hidden subgroup problem for abelian finite groups",Quantum Computing
These algorithms depend on the primitive of the quantum Fourier transform,Quantum Computing
"No mathematical proof has been found that shows that an equally fast classical algorithm cannot be discovered, but evidence suggests that this is unlikely",Quantum Computing
"Certain oracle problems like Simon's problem and the Bernstein–Vazirani problem do give provable speedups, though this is in the quantum query model, which is a restricted model where lower bounds are much easier to prove and doesn't necessarily translate to speedups for practical problems.
Other problems, including the simulation of quantum physical processes from chemistry and solid-state physics, the approximation of certain Jones polynomials, and the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations have quantum algorithms appearing to give super-polynomial speedups and are BQP-complete",Quantum Computing
"Because these problems are BQP-complete, an equally fast classical algorithm for them would imply that no quantum algorithm gives a super-polynomial speedup, which is believed to be unlikely.
Some quantum algorithms, like Grover's algorithm and amplitude amplification, give polynomial speedups over corresponding classical algorithms",Quantum Computing
"Though these algorithms give comparably modest quadratic speedup, they are widely applicable and thus give speedups for a wide range of problems.


=== Simulation of quantum systems ===

Since chemistry and nanotechnology rely on understanding quantum systems, and such systems are impossible to simulate in an efficient manner classically, quantum simulation may be an important application of quantum computing",Quantum Computing
Quantum simulation could also be used to simulate the behavior of atoms and particles at unusual conditions such as the reactions inside a collider,Quantum Computing
"In June 2023, IBM computer scientists reported that a quantum computer produced better results for a physics problem than a conventional supercomputer.
About 2% of the annual global energy output is used for nitrogen fixation to produce ammonia for the Haber process in the agricultural fertilizer industry (even though naturally occurring organisms also produce ammonia)",Quantum Computing
Quantum simulations might be used to understand this process and increase the energy efficiency of production,Quantum Computing
"It is expected that an early use of quantum computing will be modeling that improves the efficiency of the Haber–Bosch process by the mid 2020s although some have predicted it will take longer.


=== Post-quantum cryptography ===

A notable application of quantum computation is for attacks on cryptographic systems that are currently in use",Quantum Computing
"Integer factorization, which underpins the security of public key cryptographic systems, is believed to be computationally infeasible with an ordinary computer for large integers if they are the product of few prime numbers (e.g., products of two 300-digit primes)",Quantum Computing
"By comparison, a quantum computer could solve this problem exponentially faster using Shor's algorithm to find its factors",Quantum Computing
"This ability would allow a quantum computer to break many of the cryptographic systems in use today, in the sense that there would be a polynomial time (in the number of digits of the integer) algorithm for solving the problem",Quantum Computing
"In particular, most of the popular public key ciphers are based on the difficulty of factoring integers or the discrete logarithm problem, both of which can be solved by Shor's algorithm",Quantum Computing
"In particular, the RSA, Diffie–Hellman, and elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman algorithms could be broken",Quantum Computing
"These are used to protect secure Web pages, encrypted email, and many other types of data",Quantum Computing
"Breaking these would have significant ramifications for electronic privacy and security.
Identifying cryptographic systems that may be secure against quantum algorithms is an actively researched topic under the field of post-quantum cryptography",Quantum Computing
"Some public-key algorithms are based on problems other than the integer factorization and discrete logarithm problems to which Shor's algorithm applies, like the McEliece cryptosystem based on a problem in coding theory",Quantum Computing
"Lattice-based cryptosystems are also not known to be broken by quantum computers, and finding a polynomial time algorithm for solving the dihedral hidden subgroup problem, which would break many lattice based cryptosystems, is a well-studied open problem",Quantum Computing
"It has been proven that applying Grover's algorithm to break a symmetric (secret key) algorithm by brute force requires time equal to roughly 2n/2 invocations of the underlying cryptographic algorithm, compared with roughly 2n in the classical case, meaning that symmetric key lengths are effectively halved: AES-256 would have the same security against an attack using Grover's algorithm that AES-128 has against classical brute-force search (see Key size).


=== Search problems ===

The most well-known example of a problem that allows for a polynomial quantum speedup is unstructured search, which involves finding a marked item out of a list of 
  
    
      
        n
      
    
    {\displaystyle n}
  
 items in a database",Quantum Computing
"This can be solved by Grover's algorithm using 
  
    
      
        O
        (
        
          
            n
          
        
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle O({\sqrt {n}})}
  
 queries to the database, quadratically fewer than the 
  
    
      
        Ω
        (
        n
        )
      
    
    {\displaystyle \Omega (n)}
  
 queries required for classical algorithms",Quantum Computing
"In this case, the advantage is not only provable but also optimal: it has been shown that Grover's algorithm gives the maximal possible probability of finding the desired element for any number of oracle lookups",Quantum Computing
"Many examples of provable quantum speedups for query problems are based on Grover's algorithm, including Brassard, Høyer, and Tapp's algorithm for finding collisions in two-to-one functions, and Farhi, Goldstone, and Gutmann's algorithm for evaluating NAND trees.
Problems that can be efficiently addressed with Grover's algorithm have the following properties:

There is no searchable structure in the collection of possible answers,
The number of possible answers to check is the same as the number of inputs to the algorithm, and
There exists a Boolean function that evaluates each input and determines whether it is the correct answer.
For problems with all these properties, the running time of Grover's algorithm on a quantum computer scales as the square root of the number of inputs (or elements in the database), as opposed to the linear scaling of classical algorithms",Quantum Computing
"A general class of problems to which Grover's algorithm can be applied is a Boolean satisfiability problem, where the database through which the algorithm iterates is that of all possible answers",Quantum Computing
An example and possible application of this is a password cracker that attempts to guess a password,Quantum Computing
"Breaking symmetric ciphers with this algorithm is of interest to government agencies.


=== Quantum annealing ===
Quantum annealing relies on the adiabatic theorem to undertake calculations",Quantum Computing
"A system is placed in the ground state for a simple Hamiltonian, which slowly evolves to a more complicated Hamiltonian whose ground state represents the solution to the problem in question",Quantum Computing
The adiabatic theorem states that if the evolution is slow enough the system will stay in its ground state at all times through the process,Quantum Computing
"Adiabatic optimization may be helpful for solving computational biology problems.


=== Machine learning ===

Since quantum computers can produce outputs that classical computers cannot produce efficiently, and since quantum computation is fundamentally linear algebraic, some express hope in developing quantum algorithms that can speed up machine learning tasks.
For example, the HHL Algorithm, named after its discoverers Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, is believed to provide speedup over classical counterparts",Quantum Computing
"Some research groups have recently explored the use of quantum annealing hardware for training Boltzmann machines and deep neural networks.

Deep generative chemistry models emerge as powerful tools to expedite drug discovery",Quantum Computing
"However, the immense size and complexity of the structural space of all possible drug-like molecules pose significant obstacles, which could be overcome in the future by quantum computers",Quantum Computing
Quantum computers are naturally good for solving complex quantum many-body problems and thus may be instrumental in applications involving quantum chemistry,Quantum Computing
"Therefore, one can expect that quantum-enhanced generative models including quantum GANs may eventually be developed into ultimate generative chemistry algorithms.


== Engineering ==

As of 2023, classical computers outperform quantum computers for all real-world applications",Quantum Computing
"While current quantum computers may speed up solutions to particular mathematical problems, they give no computational advantage for practical tasks",Quantum Computing
"Scientists and engineers are exploring multiple technologies for quantum computing hardware and hope to develop scalable quantum architectures, but serious obstacles remain.


=== Challenges ===
There are a number of technical challenges in building a large-scale quantum computer",Quantum Computing
"Physicist David DiVincenzo has listed these requirements for a practical quantum computer:

Physically scalable to increase the number of qubits
Qubits that can be initialized to arbitrary values
Quantum gates that are faster than decoherence time
Universal gate set
Qubits that can be read easily.
Sourcing parts for quantum computers is also very difficult",Quantum Computing
"Superconducting quantum computers, like those constructed by Google and IBM, need helium-3, a nuclear research byproduct, and special superconducting cables made only by the Japanese company Coax Co.
The control of multi-qubit systems requires the generation and coordination of a large number of electrical signals with tight and deterministic timing resolution",Quantum Computing
This has led to the development of quantum controllers that enable interfacing with the qubits,Quantum Computing
"Scaling these systems to support a growing number of qubits is an additional challenge.


==== Decoherence ====
One of the greatest challenges involved with constructing quantum computers is controlling or removing quantum decoherence",Quantum Computing
This usually means isolating the system from its environment as interactions with the external world cause the system to decohere,Quantum Computing
"Examples include the quantum gates, and the lattice vibrations and background thermonuclear spin of the physical system used to implement the qubits",Quantum Computing
"Decoherence is irreversible, as it is effectively non-unitary, and is usually something that should be highly controlled, if not avoided",Quantum Computing
"Decoherence times for candidate systems in particular, the transverse relaxation time T2 (for NMR and MRI technology, also called the dephasing time), typically range between nanoseconds and seconds at low temperature",Quantum Computing
"Currently, some quantum computers require their qubits to be cooled to 20 millikelvin (usually using a dilution refrigerator) in order to prevent significant decoherence",Quantum Computing
"A 2020 study argues that ionizing radiation such as cosmic rays can nevertheless cause certain systems to decohere within milliseconds.
As a result, time-consuming tasks may render some quantum algorithms inoperable, as attempting to maintain the state of qubits for a long enough duration will eventually corrupt the superpositions.
These issues are more difficult for optical approaches as the timescales are orders of magnitude shorter and an often-cited approach to overcoming them is optical pulse shaping",Quantum Computing
"Error rates are typically proportional to the ratio of operating time to decoherence time, hence any operation must be completed much more quickly than the decoherence time.
As described by the threshold theorem, if the error rate is small enough, it is thought to be possible to use quantum error correction to suppress errors and decoherence",Quantum Computing
This allows the total calculation time to be longer than the decoherence time if the error correction scheme can correct errors faster than decoherence introduces them,Quantum Computing
"An often-cited figure for the required error rate in each gate for fault-tolerant computation is 10−3, assuming the noise is depolarizing.
Meeting this scalability condition is possible for a wide range of systems",Quantum Computing
"However, the use of error correction brings with it the cost of a greatly increased number of required qubits",Quantum Computing
"The number required to factor integers using Shor's algorithm is still polynomial, and thought to be between L and L2, where L is the number of digits in the number to be factored; error correction algorithms would inflate this figure by an additional factor of L",Quantum Computing
"For a 1000-bit number, this implies a need for about 104 bits without error correction",Quantum Computing
"With error correction, the figure would rise to about 107 bits",Quantum Computing
"Computation time is about L2 or about 107 steps and at 1 MHz, about 10 seconds",Quantum Computing
"However, the encoding and error-correction overheads increase the size of a real fault-tolerant quantum computer by several orders of magnitude",Quantum Computing
"Careful estimates show that at least 3 million physical qubits would factor 2,048-bit integer in 5 months on a fully error-corrected trapped-ion quantum computer",Quantum Computing
"In terms of the number of physical qubits, to date, this remains the lowest estimate for practically useful integer factorization problem sizing 1,024-bit or larger.
Another approach to the stability-decoherence problem is to create a topological quantum computer with anyons, quasi-particles used as threads, and relying on braid theory to form stable logic gates.


=== Quantum supremacy ===
Physicist John Preskill coined the term quantum supremacy to describe the engineering feat of demonstrating that a programmable quantum device can solve a problem beyond the capabilities of state-of-the-art classical computers",Quantum Computing
"The problem need not be useful, so some view the quantum supremacy test only as a potential future benchmark.
In October 2019, Google AI Quantum, with the help of NASA, became the first to claim to have achieved quantum supremacy by performing calculations on the Sycamore quantum computer more than 3,000,000 times faster than they could be done on Summit, generally considered the world's fastest computer",Quantum Computing
"This claim has been subsequently challenged: IBM has stated that Summit can perform samples much faster than claimed, and researchers have since developed better algorithms for the sampling problem used to claim quantum supremacy, giving substantial reductions to the gap between Sycamore and classical supercomputers and even beating it.
In December 2020, a group at USTC implemented a type of Boson sampling on 76 photons with a photonic quantum computer, Jiuzhang, to demonstrate quantum supremacy",Quantum Computing
"The authors claim that a classical contemporary supercomputer would require a computational time of 600 million years to generate the number of samples their quantum processor can generate in 20 seconds.
Claims of quantum supremacy have generated hype around quantum computing, but they are based on contrived benchmark tasks that do not directly imply useful real-world applications.
In January 2024, a study published in Physical Review Letters provided direct verification of quantum supremacy experiments by computing exact amplitudes for experimentally generated bitstrings using a new-generation Sunway supercomputer, demonstrating a significant leap in simulation capability built on a multiple-amplitude tensor network contraction algorithm",Quantum Computing
"This development underscores the evolving landscape of quantum computing, highlighting both the progress and the complexities involved in validating quantum supremacy claims.


=== Skepticism ===
Despite high hopes for quantum computing, significant progress in hardware, and optimism about future applications, a 2023 Nature spotlight article summarised current quantum computers as being ""For now, [good for] absolutely nothing""",Quantum Computing
"The article elaborated that quantum computers are yet to be more useful or efficient than conventional computers in any case, though it also argued that in the long term such computers are likely to be useful",Quantum Computing
"A 2023 Communications of the ACM article found that current quantum computing algorithms are ""insufficient for practical quantum advantage without significant improvements across the software/hardware stack""",Quantum Computing
"It argues that the most promising candidates for achieving speedup with quantum computers are ""small-data problems"", for example in chemistry and materials science",Quantum Computing
"However, the article also concludes that a large range of the potential applications it considered, such as machine learning, ""will not achieve quantum advantage with current quantum algorithms in the foreseeable future"", and it identified I/O constraints that make speedup unlikely for ""big data problems, unstructured linear systems, and database search based on Grover's algorithm"".
This state of affairs can be traced to several current and long-term considerations.

Conventional computer hardware and algorithms are not only optimized for practical tasks, but are still improving rapidly, particularly GPU accelerators.
Current quantum computing hardware generates only a limited amount of entanglement before getting overwhelmed by noise.
Quantum algorithms provide speedup over conventional algorithms only for some tasks, and matching these tasks with practical applications proved challenging",Quantum Computing
Some promising tasks and applications require resources far beyond those available today,Quantum Computing
"In particular, processing large amounts of non-quantum data is a challenge for quantum computers.
Some promising algorithms have been ""dequantized"", i.e., their non-quantum analogues with similar complexity have been found.
If quantum error correction is used to scale quantum computers to practical applications, its overhead may undermine speedup offered by many quantum algorithms.
Complexity analysis of algorithms sometimes makes abstract assumptions that do not hold in applications",Quantum Computing
"For example, input data may not already be available encoded in quantum states, and ""oracle functions"" used in Grover's algorithm often have internal structure that can be exploited for faster algorithms.
In particular, building computers with large numbers of qubits may be futile if those qubits are not connected well enough and cannot maintain sufficiently high degree of entanglement for long time",Quantum Computing
"When trying to outperform conventional computers, quantum computing researchers often look for new tasks that can be solved on quantum computers, but this leaves the possibility that efficient non-quantum techniques will be developed in response, as seen for Quantum supremacy demonstrations",Quantum Computing
"Therefore, it is desirable to prove lower bounds on the complexity of best possible non-quantum algorithms (which may be unknown) and show that some quantum algorithms asymptomatically improve upon those bounds.
Some researchers have expressed skepticism that scalable quantum computers could ever be built, typically because of the issue of maintaining coherence at large scales, but also for other reasons.
Bill Unruh doubted the practicality of quantum computers in a paper published in 1994",Quantum Computing
Paul Davies argued that a 400-qubit computer would even come into conflict with the cosmological information bound implied by the holographic principle,Quantum Computing
Skeptics like Gil Kalai doubt that quantum supremacy will ever be achieved,Quantum Computing
"Physicist Mikhail Dyakonov has expressed skepticism of quantum computing as follows:

""So the number of continuous parameters describing the state of such a useful quantum computer at any given moment must be..",Quantum Computing
Could we ever learn to control the more than 10300 continuously variable parameters defining the quantum state of such a system? My answer is simple,Quantum Computing
"No, never.""


=== Physical realizations ===

A practical quantum computer must use a physical system as a programmable quantum register",Quantum Computing
Researchers are exploring several technologies as candidates for reliable qubit implementations,Quantum Computing
"Superconductors and trapped ions are some of the most developed proposals, but experimentalists are considering other hardware possibilities as well.
The first quantum logic gates were implemented with trapped ions and prototype general purpose machines with up to 20 qubits have been realized",Quantum Computing
"However the technology behind these devices combines complex vacuum equipment, lasers, microwave and radio frequency equipment making full scale processors difficult to integrate with standard computing equipment",Quantum Computing
"Moreover the trapped ion system itself has engineering challenges to overcome.
The largest commercial systems are based on superconductor devices and have scaled to 2000 qubits",Quantum Computing
However the error rates for larger machines have been on the order of 5%,Quantum Computing
"Technologically these devices are all cryogenic and scaling to large numbers of qubits requires wafer-scale integration, a serious engineering challenge by itself.


== Theory ==


=== Computability ===

Any computational problem solvable by a classical computer is also solvable by a quantum computer",Quantum Computing
"Intuitively, this is because it is believed that all physical phenomena, including the operation of classical computers, can be described using quantum mechanics, which underlies the operation of quantum computers.
Conversely, any problem solvable by a quantum computer is also solvable by a classical computer",Quantum Computing
"It is possible to simulate both quantum and classical computers manually with just some paper and a pen, if given enough time",Quantum Computing
"More formally, any quantum computer can be simulated by a Turing machine",Quantum Computing
"In other words, quantum computers provide no additional power over classical computers in terms of computability",Quantum Computing
"This means that quantum computers cannot solve undecidable problems like the halting problem, and the existence of quantum computers does not disprove the Church–Turing thesis.


=== Complexity ===

While quantum computers cannot solve any problems that classical computers cannot already solve, it is suspected that they can solve certain problems faster than classical computers",Quantum Computing
"For instance, it is known that quantum computers can efficiently factor integers, while this is not believed to be the case for classical computers.
The class of problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer with bounded error is called BQP, for ""bounded error, quantum, polynomial time""",Quantum Computing
"More formally, BQP is the class of problems that can be solved by a polynomial-time quantum Turing machine with an error probability of at most 1/3",Quantum Computing
"As a class of probabilistic problems, BQP is the quantum counterpart to BPP (""bounded error, probabilistic, polynomial time""), the class of problems that can be solved by polynomial-time probabilistic Turing machines with bounded error",Quantum Computing
"It is known that 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
            P
            P
            ⊆
            B
            Q
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {BPP\subseteq BQP}}}
  
 and is widely suspected that 
  
    
      
        
          
            B
            Q
            P
            ⊊
            B
            P
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {BQP\subsetneq BPP}}}
  
, which intuitively would mean that quantum computers are more powerful than classical computers in terms of time complexity.

The exact relationship of BQP to P, NP, and PSPACE is not known",Quantum Computing
"However, it is known that 
  
    
      
        
          
            P
            ⊆
            B
            Q
            P
            ⊆
            P
            S
            P
            A
            C
            E
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {P\subseteq BQP\subseteq PSPACE}}}
  
; that is, all problems that can be efficiently solved by a deterministic classical computer can also be efficiently solved by a quantum computer, and all problems that can be efficiently solved by a quantum computer can also be solved by a deterministic classical computer with polynomial space resources",Quantum Computing
"It is further suspected that BQP is a strict superset of P, meaning there are problems that are efficiently solvable by quantum computers that are not efficiently solvable by deterministic classical computers",Quantum Computing
"For instance, integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are known to be in BQP and are suspected to be outside of P",Quantum Computing
"On the relationship of BQP to NP, little is known beyond the fact that some NP problems that are believed not to be in P are also in BQP (integer factorization and the discrete logarithm problem are both in NP, for example)",Quantum Computing
"It is suspected that 
  
    
      
        
          
            N
            P
            ⊈
            B
            Q
            P
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle {\mathsf {NP\nsubseteq BQP}}}
  
; that is, it is believed that there are efficiently checkable problems that are not efficiently solvable by a quantum computer",Quantum Computing
"As a direct consequence of this belief, it is also suspected that BQP is disjoint from the class of NP-complete problems (if an NP-complete problem were in BQP, then it would follow from NP-hardness that all problems in NP are in BQP).

"In common usage, climate change describes global warming—the ongoing increase in global average temperature—and its effects on Earth's climate system",Climate Change
Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earth's climate,Climate Change
The current rise in global average temperature is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels since the Industrial Revolution,Climate Change
"Fossil fuel use, deforestation, and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases",Climate Change
"These gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight, warming the lower atmosphere",Climate Change
"Carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas driving global warming, has grown by about 50% and is at levels unseen for millions of years.
Climate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment",Climate Change
"Deserts are expanding, while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common",Climate Change
"Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost, retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline",Climate Change
"Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms, droughts, and other weather extremes",Climate Change
"Rapid environmental change in mountains, coral reefs, and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct",Climate Change
"Even if efforts to minimize future warming are successful, some effects will continue for centuries",Climate Change
"These include ocean heating, ocean acidification and sea level rise.
Climate change threatens people with increased flooding, extreme heat, increased food and water scarcity, more disease, and economic loss",Climate Change
The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century,Climate Change
Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming,Climate Change
"Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks, although some limits to adaptation have already been reached",Climate Change
"Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions, yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change.

Many climate change impacts have been felt in recent years, with 2023 the warmest on record at +1.48 °C (2.66 °F) since regular tracking began in 1850",Climate Change
"Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points, such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet",Climate Change
"Under the 2015 Paris Agreement, nations collectively agreed to keep warming ""well under 2 °C""",Climate Change
"However, with pledges made under the Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by the end of the century",Climate Change
"Limiting warming to 1.5 °C would require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 2050.
Fossil fuel use can be phased out by conserving energy and switching to energy sources that do not produce significant carbon pollution",Climate Change
"These energy sources include wind, solar, hydro, and nuclear power",Climate Change
"Cleanly generated electricity can replace fossil fuels for powering transportation, heating buildings, and running industrial processes",Climate Change
"Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere, for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil.


== Terminology ==
Before the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution",Climate Change
Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time,Climate Change
"In the 1980s, the terms global warming and climate change became more common, often being used interchangeably",Climate Change
"Scientifically, global warming refers only to increased surface warming, while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earth's climate system, such as precipitation changes.
Climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout Earth's history",Climate Change
Global warming—used as early as 1975—became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the U.S,Climate Change
"Various scientists, politicians and media may use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change, and may use the term global heating instead of global warming.


== Global temperature rise ==


=== Temperature records prior to global warming ===

Over the last few million years human beings evolved in a climate that cycled through ice ages, with global average temperature ranging between 1 °C warmer and 5–6 °C colder than current levels",Climate Change
"One of the hotter periods was the Last Interglacial between 115,000 and 130,000 years ago, when sea levels were 6 to 9 metres higher than today",Climate Change
"The most recent glacial maximum 20,000 years ago had sea levels that were about 125 metres (410 ft) lower than today.
Temperatures stabilized in the current interglacial period beginning 11,700 years ago",Climate Change
"Historical patterns of warming and cooling, like the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age, did not occur at the same time across different regions",Climate Change
Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions,Climate Change
"Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies, such as trees and ice cores.


=== Warming since the Industrial Revolution ===

Around 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage.
Between the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming, as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions",Climate Change
"Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain, but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere, which reflect sunlight and cause so-called global dimming",Climate Change
"After 1970, the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature.
Ongoing changes in climate have had no precedent for several thousand years",Climate Change
"Multiple independent datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature, at a rate of around 0.2 °C per decade",Climate Change
The 2013–2022 decade warmed to an average 1.15 °C [1.00–1.25 °C] compared to the pre-industrial baseline (1850–1900),Climate Change
Not every single year was warmer than the last: internal climate variability processes can make any year 0.2 °C warmer or colder than the average,Climate Change
"From 1998 to 2013, negative phases of two such processes, Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO) caused a so-called ""global warming hiatus""",Climate Change
"After the hiatus, the opposite occurred, with years like 2023 exhibiting temperatures well above even the recent average",Climate Change
"This is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20-year average, which reduces the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns, and detects the long-term signal.: 5 
A wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming",Climate Change
"The upper atmosphere is cooling, because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earth's surface, and so less heat is radiating into space",Climate Change
Warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers,Climate Change
"At the same time, warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans, leading to more atmospheric humidity, more and heavier precipitation",Climate Change
"Plants are flowering earlier in spring, and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas.


==== Differences by region ====
Different regions of the world warm at different rates",Climate Change
"The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted, because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet",Climate Change
"Since the pre-industrial period, the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global average surface temperature",Climate Change
This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat,Climate Change
"The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970, and over 90% of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean",Climate Change
"The rest has heated the atmosphere, melted ice, and warmed the continents.
The Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere",Climate Change
"The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land, but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice",Climate Change
"As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted, they start absorbing more heat",Climate Change
Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming,Climate Change
Arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world,Climate Change
"Melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the Atlantic and the Antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation, which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe.


=== Future global temperatures ===

The World Meteorological Organization estimates a 66% chance of global temperatures exceeding 1.5 °C warming from the preindustrial baseline for at least one year between 2023 and 2027",Climate Change
"Because the IPCC uses a 20-year average to define global temperature changes, a single year exceeding 1.5 °C does not break the limit.
The IPCC expects the 20-year average global temperature to exceed +1.5 °C in the early 2030s",Climate Change
"The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report (2023) included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 1.0-1.8 °C under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases, 2.1-3.5 °C under an intermediate emissions scenario,
or 3.3-5.7 °C under a very high emissions scenario",Climate Change
"The warming will continue past 2100 in the intermediate and high emission scenarios, with future projections of global surface temperatures by year 2300 being similar to millions of years ago.
The remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases",Climate Change
"According to the IPCC, global warming can be kept below 1.5 °C with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of CO2",Climate Change
This corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions,Climate Change
"For instance, it may be 100 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent smaller due to CO2 and methane release from permafrost and wetlands",Climate Change
"However, it is clear that fossil fuel resources need to be proactively kept in the ground to prevent substantial warming",Climate Change
"Otherwise, their shortages would not occur until the emissions have already locked in significant long-term impacts.


== Causes of recent global temperature rise ==

The climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years, decades or even centuries",Climate Change
"For example, El Niño events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Niña events cause short term cooling",Climate Change
Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale,Climate Change
Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings,Climate Change
"Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases, solar luminosity, volcanic eruptions, and variations in the Earth's orbit around the Sun.
To determine the human contribution to climate change, unique ""fingerprints"" for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability",Climate Change
"For example, solar forcing—whose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphere—is ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed",Climate Change
"Other drivers, such as changes in albedo, are less impactful.


=== Greenhouse gases ===

Greenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight, and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earth's surface",Climate Change
"The Earth radiates it as heat, and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it",Climate Change
"This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space, trapping heat near the Earth's surface and warming it over time.
While water vapour (≈50%) and clouds (≈25%) are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect, they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity",Climate Change
"On the other hand, concentrations of gases such as CO2 (≈20%), tropospheric ozone, CFCs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature, and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures.
Before the Industrial Revolution, naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33 °C warmer than it would have been in their absence",Climate Change
"Human activity since the Industrial Revolution, mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas), has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, resulting in a radiative imbalance",Climate Change
"In 2019, the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 48% and 160%, respectively, since 1750",Climate Change
These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years,Climate Change
"Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800,000 years.

Global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59 billion tonnes of CO2",Climate Change
"Of these emissions, 75% was CO2, 18% was methane, 4% was nitrous oxide, and 2% was fluorinated gases",Climate Change
"CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport, manufacturing, heating, and electricity",Climate Change
"Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes, which include the CO2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement, steel, aluminum, and fertilizer",Climate Change
"Methane emissions come from livestock, manure, rice cultivation, landfills, wastewater, and coal mining, as well as oil and gas extraction",Climate Change
"Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertilizer.
While methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years, CO2 lasts much longer",Climate Change
The Earth's surface absorbs CO2 as part of the carbon cycle,Climate Change
"While plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of CO2 every year, that CO2 is returned to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested, burns, or decays",Climate Change
"Land-surface carbon sink processes, such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis, remove about 29% of annual global CO2 emissions",Climate Change
The ocean has absorbed 20 to 30% of emitted CO2 over the last 2 decades,Climate Change
"CO2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the Earth's crust, which is a process that can take millions of years to complete.


=== Land surface changes ===

According to Food and Agriculture Organization, around 30% of Earth's land area is largely unusable for humans (glaciers, deserts, etc.), 26% is forests, 10% is shrubland and 34% is agricultural land",Climate Change
"Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming, as the destroyed trees release CO2, and are not replaced by new trees, removing that carbon sink",Climate Change
"Between 2001 and 2018, 27% of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock",Climate Change
Another 24% has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems,Climate Change
"26% was due to logging for wood and derived products, and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23%",Climate Change
"Some forests have not been fully cleared, but were already degraded by these impacts",Climate Change
"Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink.
Local vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation",Climate Change
"For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight",Climate Change
"Deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns",Climate Change
"In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler",Climate Change
"At latitudes closer to the poles, there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snow-covered (and more reflective) plains",Climate Change
"Globally, these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change",Climate Change
"Thus, land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect.


=== Other factors ===


==== Aerosols and clouds ====
Air pollution, in the form of aerosols, affects the climate on a large scale",Climate Change
"From 1961 to 1990, a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earth's surface was observed",Climate Change
"This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming, and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel",Climate Change
"Smaller contributions come from black carbon, organic carbon from combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels, and from anthropogenic dust",Climate Change
"Globally, aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls, meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much.
Aerosols also have indirect effects on the Earth's energy budget",Climate Change
Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets,Climate Change
These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets,Climate Change
"They also reduce the growth of raindrops, which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight",Climate Change
"Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing.
While aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight, black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming",Climate Change
"Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight, it also increases melting and sea-level rise",Climate Change
Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 0.2 °C by 2050,Climate Change
"The effect of decreasing sulfur content of fuel oil for ships since 2020 is estimated to cause an additional 0.05 °C increase in global mean temperature by 2050.


==== Solar and volcanic activity ====

As the Sun is the Earth's primary energy source, changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system",Climate Change
"Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites, and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards",Climate Change
"Since 1880, there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Sun's energy reaching the Earth, in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere (the troposphere)",Climate Change
"The upper atmosphere (the stratosphere) would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth, but instead, it has been cooling.
This is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earth's atmosphere.
Explosive volcanic eruptions can release gases, dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures, or they can send water vapour into the atmosphere, which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures",Climate Change
"These impacts on temperature only last for several years, because both water vapour and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere",Climate Change
"volcanic CO2 emissions are more persistent, but they are equivalent to less than 1% of current human-caused CO2 emissions",Climate Change
Volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact (forcing) on temperature in the industrial era,Climate Change
"Yet, like the other natural forcings, it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the Industrial Revolution.


==== Climate change feedbacks ====

The response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks: increased by ""self-reinforcing"" or ""positive"" feedbacks and reduced by ""balancing"" or ""negative"" feedbacks",Climate Change
"The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback, the ice–albedo feedback, and the net effect of clouds",Climate Change
"The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling, as Earth's surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature",Climate Change
"In addition to temperature feedbacks, there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle, such as the fertilizing effect of CO2 on plant growth",Climate Change
"Feedbacks are expected to trend in a positive direction as greenhouse gas emissions continue, raising climate sensitivity.
Radiative feedbacks are physical processes that influence the rate of global warming in response to warming",Climate Change
"For instance, warmer air can hold more moisture, and water vapour itself is a potent greenhouse gas",Climate Change
"Warmer air can also result in clouds becoming higher and thinner, where they act as an insulator and warm the planet",Climate Change
"Another major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic, reducing the reflectivity of the Earth's surface there and contributing to amplification of Arctic temperature changes",Climate Change
"Arctic amplification is also thawing permafrost, which releases methane and CO2 into the atmosphere.
Around half of human-caused CO2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans",Climate Change
"This fraction is not static and if future CO2 emissions decrease, the Earth will be able to absorb up to around 70%",Climate Change
"If they increase substantially, it'll still absorb more carbon than now, but the overall fraction will decrease to below 40%",Climate Change
"This is because climate change increases droughts and heat waves that eventually inhibit plant growth on land, and soils will release more carbon from dead plants when they are warmer",Climate Change
The rate at which oceans absorb atmospheric carbon will be lowered as they become more acidic and experience changes in thermohaline circulation and phytoplankton distribution,Climate Change
"Uncertainty over feedbacks, particularly cloud cover, is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions.


== Modelling ==

A climate model is a representation of the physical, chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system",Climate Change
"Models include natural processes like changes in the Earth's orbit, historical changes in the Sun's activity, and volcanic forcing",Climate Change
Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks,Climate Change
"Models also predict the circulation of the oceans, the annual cycle of the seasons, and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere.
The physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate current or past climates",Climate Change
Past models have underestimated the rate of Arctic shrinkage and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase,Climate Change
"Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models, but more recent models agree well with observations",Climate Change
"The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that ""climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes""",Climate Change
"Additionally, climate models may be unable to adequately predict short-term regional climatic shifts.
A subset of climate models add societal factors to a physical climate model",Climate Change
"These models simulate how population, economic growth, and energy use affect—and interact with—the physical climate",Climate Change
"With this information, these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions",Climate Change
This is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change,Climate Change
"Depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario, models produce atmospheric CO2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm.


== Impacts ==


=== Environmental effects ===

The environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching, affecting oceans, ice, and weather",Climate Change
"Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past, from modelling, and from modern observations",Climate Change
"Since the 1950s, droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency",Climate Change
Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia,Climate Change
Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980,Climate Change
"The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing, and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming",Climate Change
"Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change.

Global sea level is rising as a consequence of thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets",Climate Change
"Between 1993 and 2020, the rise increased over time, averaging 3.3 ± 0.3 mm per year",Climate Change
"Over the 21st century, the IPCC projects 32–62 cm of sea level rise under a low emission scenario, 44–76 cm under an intermediate one and 65–101 cm under a very high emission scenario",Climate Change
"Marine ice sheet instability processes in Antarctica may add substantially to these values, including the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions.
Climate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice",Climate Change
"While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 1.5 °C degrees of warming, they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2 °C",Climate Change
"Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations cause more CO2 to dissolve in the oceans, which is making them more acidic",Climate Change
"Because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water, its concentrations in the ocean are decreasing, and dead zones are expanding.


=== Tipping points and long-term impacts ===

Greater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through 'tipping points'—thresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state",Climate Change
"For instance, the Greenland ice sheet is already melting, but if global warming reaches levels between 1.7 °C and 2.3 °C, its melting will continue until it fully disappears",Climate Change
"If the warming is later reduced to 1.5 °C or less, it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place",Climate Change
"While the ice sheets would melt over millennia, other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond",Climate Change
"The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades.
The long-term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt, ocean warming, sea level rise, ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation",Climate Change
The timescale of long-term impacts are centuries to millennia due to CO2's long atmospheric lifetime,Climate Change
"When net emissions stabilize surface air temperatures will also stabilize, but oceans and ice caps will continue to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere",Climate Change
The result is an estimated total sea level rise of 2.3 metres per degree Celsius (4.2 ft/°F) after 2000 years,Climate Change
Oceanic CO2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will also continue for hundreds to thousands of years,Climate Change
"Deep oceans (below 2,000 metres (6,600 ft)) are also already committed to losing over 10% of their dissolved oxygen by the warming which occurred to date",Climate Change
"Further, the West Antarctic ice sheet appears committed to practically irreversible melting, which would increase the sea levels by at least 3.3 m (10 ft 10 in) over approximately 2000 years.


=== Nature and wildlife ===

Recent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes",Climate Change
"For instance, the range of hundreds of North American birds has shifted northward at an average rate of 1.5 km/year over the past 55 years",Climate Change
Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening,Climate Change
"However, heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions",Climate Change
"A related phenomenon driven by climate change is woody plant encroachment, affecting up to 500 million hectares globally",Climate Change
"Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones, such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics",Climate Change
The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely,Climate Change
"Overall, it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species.
The oceans have heated more slowly than the land, but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land",Climate Change
"Just as on land, heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change, harming a wide range of organisms such as corals, kelp, and seabirds",Climate Change
"Ocean acidification makes it harder for marine calcifying organisms such as mussels, barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons; and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs",Climate Change
"Harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels, disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life",Climate Change
Almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts,Climate Change
"Plants have come under increased stress from damage by insects.


=== Humans ===

The effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world",Climate Change
"Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions, with low-latitude, less developed areas facing the greatest risk",Climate Change
"Continued warming has potentially ""severe, pervasive and irreversible impacts"" for people and ecosystems",Climate Change
"The risks are unevenly distributed, but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries.


==== Health and food ====

The World Health Organization calls climate change one of the biggest threats to global health in the 21st century",Climate Change
"Extreme weather events affect public health, and food and water security",Climate Change
Climate change increases the intensity and frequency of extreme weather events,Climate Change
"It can affect transmission of infectious diseases, such as dengue fever and malaria",Climate Change
"According to the World Economic Forum, 14.5 million more deaths are expected due to climate change by 2050",Climate Change
30% of the global population currently live in areas where extreme heat and humidity are already associated with excess deaths,Climate Change
"By 2100, 50% to 75% of the global population would live in such areas.
While total crop yields have been increasing in the past 50 years due to agricultural improvements, climate change has already decreased the rate of yield growth",Climate Change
"While agricultural productivity has been positively affected in some high latitude areas, mid- and low-latitude areas have been negatively affected",Climate Change
"According to the World Economic Forum, an increase in drought in certain regions could cause 3.2 million deaths from malnutrition by 2050 and stunting in children",Climate Change
"With 2 °C warming, global livestock headcounts could decline by 7–10% by 2050, as less animal feed will be available",Climate Change
"If the emissions continue to increase for the rest of century, then over 9 million climate-related deaths would occur annually by 2100.


==== Livelihoods and inequality ====

Economic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences",Climate Change
"Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources",Climate Change
If warming reaches 4 °C then labour capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50%,Climate Change
"The World Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030, climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation.
Inequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change",Climate Change
"Major difficulties in mitigating, adapting to, and recovering from climate shocks are faced by marginalized people who have less control over resources",Climate Change
"Indigenous people, who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems, will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change",Climate Change
"An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities.
While women are not inherently more at risk from climate change and shocks, limits on women's resources and discriminatory gender norms constrain their adaptive capacity and resilience",Climate Change
"For example, women's work burdens, including hours worked in agriculture, tend to decline less than men's during climate shocks such as heat stress.


==== Climate migration ====

Low-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise, which makes urban flooding more common",Climate Change
"This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations, such as the Maldives and Tuvalu",Climate Change
"In some regions, the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to",Climate Change
"With worst-case climate change, models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates.
These factors can drive climate or environmental migration, within and between countries",Climate Change
"More people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise, extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources",Climate Change
"Climate change may also increase vulnerability, leading to ""trapped populations"" who are not able to move due to a lack of resources.


== Reducing and recapturing emissions ==

Climate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere, and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere",Climate Change
"In order to limit global warming to less than 1.5 °C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050, or by 2070 with a 2 °C target",Climate Change
"This requires far-reaching, systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy, land, cities, transport, buildings, and industry.
The United Nations Environment Programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the Paris Agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2 °C",Climate Change
An even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 1.5 °C goal,Climate Change
"With pledges made under the Paris Agreement as of October 2021, global warming would still have a 66% chance of reaching about 2.7 °C (range: 2.2–3.2 °C) by the end of the century",Climate Change
"Globally, limiting warming to 2 °C may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs.
Although there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 1.5 or 2 °C, most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions",Climate Change
"To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities, changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry, such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation.
Other approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk",Climate Change
Scenarios that limit global warming to 1.5 °C typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century,Climate Change
"There are concerns, though, about over-reliance on these technologies, and environmental impacts",Climate Change
Solar radiation modification (SRM) is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions,Climate Change
"However, SRM raises significant ethical and legal concerns, and the risks are imperfectly understood.


=== Clean energy ===

Renewable energy is key to limiting climate change",Climate Change
"For decades, fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80% of the world's energy use",Climate Change
"The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables (including hydropower, bioenergy, wind and solar power and geothermal energy)",Climate Change
"Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline, with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions",Climate Change
"Renewables represented 75% of all new electricity generation installed in 2019, nearly all solar and wind",Climate Change
"Other forms of clean energy, such as nuclear and hydropower, currently have a larger share of the energy supply",Climate Change
"However, their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison.
While solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations, green energy policies are needed to achieve a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewables",Climate Change
"To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation, rising to 85% or more by 2050 in some scenarios",Climate Change
"Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050.
Electricity generated from renewable sources would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport",Climate Change
"Transport can switch away from internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electric vehicles, public transit, and active transport (cycling and walking)",Climate Change
"Heating could be increasingly decarbonized with technologies like heat pumps.
There are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy, including renewables",Climate Change
"For wind and solar, there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects",Climate Change
Wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability,Climate Change
"Traditionally, hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low",Climate Change
"Going forward, battery storage can be expanded, energy demand and supply can be matched, and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs",Climate Change
Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security,Climate Change
"The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around radioactive waste, nuclear weapon proliferation, and accidents",Climate Change
"Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed, and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns.
Low-carbon energy improves human health by minimizing climate change as well as reducing air pollution deaths, which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016",Climate Change
"Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2 °C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050, whereas limiting global warming to 1.5 °C could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty",Climate Change
"Improving air quality also has economic benefits which may be larger than mitigation costs.


=== Energy conservation ===

Reducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions",Climate Change
"If less energy is needed, there is more flexibility for clean energy development",Climate Change
"It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid, and minimizes carbon-intensive infrastructure development",Climate Change
"Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals, comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy",Climate Change
"Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns, energy efficiency investments, and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain.
Strategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector",Climate Change
"In the transport sector, passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes, such as buses and trains, or use electric vehicles",Climate Change
"Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors, designing less energy-intensive products, and increasing product lifetimes",Climate Change
"In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings, and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting",Climate Change
"The use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency.


=== Agriculture and industry ===

 Agriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions, preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land, and meeting increases in world food demand",Climate Change
A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels,Climate Change
"These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products, increasing land productivity, protecting and restoring forests, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production.
On the demand side, a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets",Climate Change
Eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 3/4ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use,Climate Change
"Livestock also occupy 37% of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12% of land area used for crops, driving deforestation and land degradation.
Steel and cement production are responsible for about 13% of industrial CO2 emissions",Climate Change
"In these industries, carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production, so that reducing CO2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries.


=== Carbon sequestration ===

Natural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels",Climate Change
"Reforestation and afforestation (planting forests where there were none before) are among the most mature sequestration techniques, although the latter raises food security concerns",Climate Change
"Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops, reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage, and using compost and manure as soil amendments",Climate Change
"Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate, including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction",Climate Change
"Restoration/recreation of coastal wetlands, prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter",Climate Change
"When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees, there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use, fire, or other changes in ecosystems.
Where energy production or CO2-intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste CO2, the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere",Climate Change
"Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive, carbon capture and storage (CCS) may be able to play a significant role in limiting CO2 emissions by mid-century",Climate Change
"This technique, in combination with bioenergy (BECCS) can result in net negative emissions as CO2 is drawn from the atmosphere",Climate Change
It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 1.5 °C,Climate Change
"Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals.


== Adaptation ==

Adaptation is ""the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects"".: 5  Without additional mitigation, adaptation cannot avert the risk of ""severe, widespread and irreversible"" impacts",Climate Change
"More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation, which can be prohibitively expensive",Climate Change
"The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations, and developing countries generally have less",Climate Change
"The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity, but progress is slow",Climate Change
"However, there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance.
Adaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas, learning to live with increased flooding, and building flood controls",Climate Change
Avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody,Climate Change
"In agriculture, adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets, diversification, erosion control, and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate",Climate Change
"Insurance allows for risk-sharing, but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes",Climate Change
"Education, migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability",Climate Change
"Planting mangroves or encouraging other coastal vegetation can buffer storms.
Ecosystems adapt to climate change, a process that can be supported by human intervention",Climate Change
"By increasing connectivity between ecosystems, species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions",Climate Change
Species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favourable climate,Climate Change
"Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience, making it easier for ecosystems to adapt",Climate Change
"Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems, also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation",Climate Change
"For instance, restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely, and reduces human exposure",Climate Change
"Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system, reducing flood risk",Climate Change
"Restored forest acts as a carbon sink, but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts.
There are synergies but also trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation",Climate Change
"An example for synergy is increased food productivity, which has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation",Climate Change
"An example of a trade-off is that increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat, but increases energy demand",Climate Change
"Another trade-off example is that more compact urban development may reduce emissions from transport and construction, but may also increase the urban heat island effect, exposing people to heat-related health risks.


== Policies and politics ==

Countries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions",Climate Change
"Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities",Climate Change
"The connection is recognized in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to ""take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts""",Climate Change
"The goals on food, clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation.
The geopolitics of climate change is complex",Climate Change
"It has often been framed as a free-rider problem, in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries, but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves",Climate Change
"For instance, the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions",Climate Change
"Furthermore, net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy, causing net exporters to face stranded assets: fossil fuels they cannot sell.


=== Policy options ===
A wide range of policies, regulations, and laws are being used to reduce emissions",Climate Change
"As of 2019, carbon pricing covers about 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions",Climate Change
Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems,Climate Change
"Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached $319 billion in 2017, and $5.2 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in",Climate Change
Ending these can cause a 28% reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46% reduction in air pollution deaths,Climate Change
Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead,Climate Change
"More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards, renewable fuel standards, and air pollution regulations on heavy industry",Climate Change
"Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production.


==== Climate justice ====
Policy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality",Climate Change
"According to proponents of climate justice, the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change, while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts",Climate Change
"One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt.
Oxfam found that in 2023 the wealthiest 10% of people were responsible for 50% of global emissions, while the bottom 50% were responsible for just 8%",Climate Change
"Production of emissions is another way to look at responsibility: under that approach, the top 21 fossil fuel companies would owe cumulative climate reparations of $5.4 trillion over the period 2025–2050",Climate Change
"To achieve a just transition, people working in the fossil fuel sector would also need other jobs, and their communities would need investments.


=== International climate agreements ===

Nearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)",Climate Change
The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system,Climate Change
"As stated in the convention, this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilized in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change, food production is not threatened, and economic development can be sustained",Climate Change
The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do,Climate Change
"Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations.
The 1997 Kyoto Protocol extended the UNFCCC and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions",Climate Change
"During the negotiations, the G77 (representing developing countries) pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to ""[take] the lead"" in reducing their emissions, since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere",Climate Change
"Per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs.
The 2009 Copenhagen Accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals, and was rejected by poorer nations including the G77",Climate Change
Associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2 °C,Climate Change
"The Accord set the goal of sending $100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020, and proposed the founding of the Green Climate Fund",Climate Change
"Only in 2023 the target is expected to be achieved.
In 2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement, which aims to keep global warming well below 2.0 °C and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 1.5 °C",Climate Change
"Unlike Kyoto, no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement",Climate Change
Countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years,Climate Change
The Paris Agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported,Climate Change
"As of October 2021, 194 states and the European Union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the EU have ratified or acceded to the agreement.
The 1987 Montreal Protocol, an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases, may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so",Climate Change
"The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons, a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases",Climate Change
"This made the Montreal Protocol a stronger agreement against climate change.


=== National responses ===
In 2019, the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency",Climate Change
"That same year, the European Parliament declared a ""climate and environmental emergency""",Climate Change
The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050,Climate Change
"In 2021, the European Commission released its ""Fit for 55"" legislation package, which contains guidelines for the car industry; all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035.
Major countries in Asia have made similar pledges: South Korea and Japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050, and China by 2060",Climate Change
"While India has strong incentives for renewables, it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country",Climate Change
"Vietnam is among very few coal-dependent, fast-developing countries that pledged to phase out unabated coal power by the 2040s or as soon as possible thereafter.
As of 2021, based on information from 48 national climate plans, which represent 40% of the parties to the Paris Agreement, estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 0.5% lower compared to 2010 levels, below the 45% or 25% reduction goals to limit global warming to 1.5 °C or 2 °C, respectively.


== Society ==


=== Denial and misinformation ===

Public debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation, which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries, particularly Canada and Australia",Climate Change
"Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies, industry groups, conservative think tanks, and contrarian scientists",Climate Change
"Like the tobacco industry, the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about climate-change related scientific data and results",Climate Change
"People who hold unwarranted doubt about climate change are called climate change ""skeptics"", although ""contrarians"" or ""deniers"" are more appropriate terms.
There are different variants of climate denial: some deny that warming takes place at all, some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences, and some minimize the negative impacts of climate change",Climate Change
Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy: creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes,Climate Change
"Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions, and questioning the motives of individual scientists",Climate Change
"An echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change.


=== Public awareness and opinion ===

Climate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s",Climate Change
"Due to media coverage in the early 1990s, people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion",Climate Change
"In popular culture, the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow (2004) and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth (2006) focused on climate change.
Significant regional, gender, age and political differences exist in both public concern for, and understanding of, climate change",Climate Change
"More highly educated people, and in some countries, women and younger people, were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat",Climate Change
"College biology textbooks from the 2010s featured less content on climate change compared to those from the preceding decade, with decreasing emphasis on solutions",Climate Change
"Partisan gaps also exist in many countries, and countries with high CO2 emissions tend to be less concerned",Climate Change
Views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries,Climate Change
"Concern has increased over time, to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change, or view it as a global emergency",Climate Change
Higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change,Climate Change
"


==== Climate movement ====

Climate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change",Climate Change
"They can take the form of public demonstrations, fossil fuel divestment, lawsuits and other activities",Climate Change
"In this initiative, young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays, inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg",Climate Change
"Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport.
Litigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies",Climate Change
Activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change,Climate Change
"Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage.


== History ==


=== Early discoveries ===

Scientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change",Climate Change
"In the 1820s, Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earth's temperature was higher than the Sun's energy alone could explain",Climate Change
"Earth's atmosphere is transparent to sunlight, so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat",Climate Change
"However, the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface, and captures some of that heat, which in turn warms the planet.
In 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the Sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air, and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide (CO2)",Climate Change
"She concluded that ""An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature...""

Starting in 1859, John Tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygen—together totalling 99% of dry air—are transparent to radiated heat",Climate Change
"However, water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere",Climate Change
"Tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past, including ice ages.
Svante Arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied, but the CO2 concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes",Climate Change
"Warming from increased CO2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour, amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop",Climate Change
"In 1896, he published the first climate model of its kind, projecting that halving CO2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age",Climate Change
Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling CO2 to be around 5–6 °C,Climate Change
"Other scientists were initially sceptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more CO2 would make no difference, and that the climate would be self-regulating",Climate Change
"Beginning in 1938, Guy Stewart Callendar published evidence that climate was warming and CO2 levels were rising, but his calculations met the same objections.


=== Development of a scientific consensus ===

In the 1950s, Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum",Climate Change
This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming,Climate Change
"Around the same time, Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising, and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase",Climate Change
"The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase, which has been termed the ""Keeling Curve""",Climate Change
"Scientists alerted the public, and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansen's 1988 Congressional testimony",Climate Change
"The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the world's governments, spurred interdisciplinary research",Climate Change
"As part of the IPCC reports, scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles.
There is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities",Climate Change
"As of 2019, agreement in recent literature reached over 99%",Climate Change
No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view,Climate Change
Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change,Climate Change
National science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions,Climate Change
" The 2021 IPCC Assessment Report stated that it is ""unequivocal"" that climate change is caused by humans.

Renewable energy (or green energy) is energy from renewable natural resources that are replenished on a human timescale,Renewable Energy
"The most widely used renewable energy types are solar energy, wind power, and hydropower",Renewable Energy
Bioenergy and geothermal power are also significant in some countries,Renewable Energy
"Some also consider nuclear power a renewable power source, although this is controversial",Renewable Energy
Renewable energy installations can be large or small and are suited for both urban and rural areas,Renewable Energy
This has several benefits: electricity can move heat and vehicles efficiently and is clean at the point of consumption,Renewable Energy
"Variable renewable energy sources are those that have a fluctuating nature, such as wind power and solar power",Renewable Energy
"In contrast, controllable renewable energy sources include dammed hydroelectricity, bioenergy, or geothermal power.

Renewable energy systems have rapidly become more efficient and cheaper over the past 30 years",Renewable Energy
A large majority of worldwide newly installed electricity capacity is now renewable,Renewable Energy
"Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, have seen significant cost reductions over the past decade, making them more competitive with traditional fossil fuels",Renewable Energy
"In most countries, photovoltaic solar or onshore wind are the cheapest new-build electricity",Renewable Energy
"From 2011 to 2021, renewable energy grew from 20% to 28% of global electricity supply",Renewable Energy
"Power from the sun and wind accounted for most of this increase, growing from a combined 2% to 10%",Renewable Energy
"In 2022, renewables accounted for 30% of global electricity generation and are projected to reach over 42% by 2028",Renewable Energy
"Many countries already have renewables contributing more than 20% of their total energy supply, with some generating over half or even all their electricity from renewable sources.
The main motivation to replace fossil fuels with renewable energy sources is to slow and eventually stop climate change, which is widely agreed to be caused mostly by greenhouse gas emissions",Renewable Energy
"In general, renewable energy sources cause much lower emissions than fossil fuels",Renewable Energy
"The International Energy Agency estimates that to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources",Renewable Energy
"Renewables also cause much less air pollution than fossil fuels, improving public health, and are less noisy.

The deployment of renewable energy still faces obstacles, especially fossil fuel subsidies, lobbying by incumbent power providers, and local opposition to the use of land for renewable installations",Renewable Energy
"Like all mining, the extraction of minerals required for many renewable energy technologies also results in environmental damage",Renewable Energy
"In addition, although most renewable energy sources are sustainable, some are not",Renewable Energy
"


== Overview ==


=== Definition ===
Renewable energy is usually understood as energy harnessed from continuously occurring natural phenomena",Renewable Energy
"The International Energy Agency defines it as ""energy derived from natural processes that are replenished at a faster rate than they are consumed""",Renewable Energy
"Solar power, wind power, hydroelectricity, geothermal energy, and biomass are widely agreed to be the main types of renewable energy",Renewable Energy
"Renewable energy often displaces conventional fuels in four areas: electricity generation, hot water/space heating, transportation, and rural (off-grid) energy services.
Although almost all forms of renewable energy cause much fewer carbon emissions than fossil fuels, the term is not synonymous with low-carbon energy",Renewable Energy
"Some non-renewable sources of energy, such as nuclear power,generate almost no emissions, while some renewable energy sources can be very carbon-intensive, such as the burning of biomass if it is not offset by planting new plants",Renewable Energy
"Renewable energy is also distinct from sustainable energy, a more abstract concept that seeks to group energy sources based on their overall permanent impact on future generations of humans",Renewable Energy
"For example, biomass is often associated with unsustainable deforestation.


=== Role in addressing climate change ===
As part of the global effort to limit climate change, most countries have committed to net zero greenhouse gas emissions",Renewable Energy
"In practice, this means phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with low-emissions energy sources",Renewable Energy
"At the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference, around three-quarters of the world's countries set a goal of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030",Renewable Energy
"The European Union aims to generate 40% of its electricity from renewables by the same year.


=== Other benefits ===

Renewable energy is more evenly distributed around the world than fossil fuels, which are concentrated in a limited number of countries",Renewable Energy
It also brings health benefits by reducing air pollution caused by the burning of fossil fuels,Renewable Energy
"The potential worldwide savings in health care costs have been estimated at trillions of dollars annually.


=== Intermittency ===

The two most important forms of renewable energy, solar and wind, are intermittent energy sources: they are not available constantly, resulting in lower capacity factors",Renewable Energy
"In contrast, fossil fuel power plants are usually able to produce precisely the amount of energy an electricity grid requires at a given time",Renewable Energy
"Solar energy can only be captured during the day, and ideally in cloudless conditions",Renewable Energy
"Wind power generation can vary significantly not only day-to-day, but even month-to-month",Renewable Energy
This poses a challenge when transitioning away from fossil fuels: energy demand will often be higher or lower than what renewables can provide,Renewable Energy
"Both scenarios can cause electricity grids to become overloaded, leading to power outages.
In the medium-term, this variability may require keeping some gas-fired power plants or other dispatchable generation on standby until there is enough energy storage, demand response, grid improvement, and/or baseload power from non-intermittent sources",Renewable Energy
"In the long-term, energy storage is an important way of dealing with intermittency",Renewable Energy
"Using diversified renewable energy sources and smart grids can also help flatten supply and demand.
Sector coupling of the power generation sector with other sectors may increase flexibility: for example the transport sector can be coupled by charging electric vehicles and sending electricity from vehicle to grid",Renewable Energy
"Similarly the industry sector can be coupled by hydrogen produced by electrolysis, and the buildings sector by thermal energy storage for space heating and cooling.
Building overcapacity for wind and solar generation can help ensure sufficient electricity production even during poor weather",Renewable Energy
"In optimal weather, it may be necessary to curtail energy generation if it is not possible to use or store excess electricity.


==== Electrical energy storage ====

Electrical energy storage is a collection of methods used to store electrical energy",Renewable Energy
"Electrical energy is stored during times when production (especially from intermittent sources such as wind power, tidal power, solar power) exceeds consumption, and returned to the grid when production falls below consumption",Renewable Energy
Pumped-storage hydroelectricity accounts for more than 85% of all grid power storage,Renewable Energy
Batteries are increasingly being deployed for storage and grid ancillary services and for domestic storage,Renewable Energy
"Green hydrogen is a more economical means of long-term renewable energy storage, in terms of capital expenditures compared to pumped hydroelectric or batteries.


== Mainstream technologies ==


=== Solar energy ===

Solar power produced around 1.3 terrawatt-hours (TWh) worldwide in 2022, representing 4.6% of the world's electricity",Renewable Energy
"Solar energy can be harnessed anywhere that receives sunlight; however, the amount of solar energy that can be harnessed for electricity generation is influenced by weather conditions, geographic location and time of day.
There are two mainstream ways of harnessing solar energy: solar thermal, which converts solar energy into heat; and photovoltaics (PV), which converts it into electricity",Renewable Energy
"PV is far more widespread, accounting for around two thirds of the global solar energy capacity as of 2022",Renewable Energy
"It is also growing at a much faster rate, with 170 GW newly installed capacity in 2021, compared to 25 GW of solar thermal.
Passive solar refers to a range of construction strategies and technologies that aim to optimize the distribution of solar heat in a building",Renewable Energy
"Examples include solar chimneys, orienting a building to the sun, using construction materials that can store heat, and designing spaces that naturally circulate air.
From 2020 to 2022, solar technology investments almost doubled from USD 162 billion to USD 308 billion, driven by the sector's increasing maturity and cost reductions, particularly in solar photovoltaic (PV), which accounted for 90% of total investments",Renewable Energy
"China and the United States were the main recipients, collectively making up about half of all solar investments since 2013",Renewable Energy
"Despite reductions in Japan and India due to policy changes and COVID-19, growth in China, the United States, and a significant increase from Vietnam's feed-in tariff program offset these declines",Renewable Energy
"Globally, the solar sector added 714 gigawatts (GW) of solar PV and concentrated solar power (CSP) capacity between 2013 and 2021, with a notable rise in large-scale solar heating installations in 2021, especially in China, Europe, Turkey, and Mexico.


==== Photovoltaics ====

A photovoltaic system, consisting of solar cells assembled into panels, converts light into electrical direct current via the photoelectric effect",Renewable Energy
PV has several advantages that make it by far the fastest-growing renewable energy technology,Renewable Energy
"It is cheap, low-maintenance and scalable; adding to an existing PV installation as demanded arises is simple",Renewable Energy
"Its main disadvantage is its poor performance in cloudy weather.
PV systems range from small, residential and commercial rooftop or building integrated installations, to large utility-scale photovoltaic power station",Renewable Energy
"A household's solar panels can either be used for just that household or, if connected to an electrical grid, can be aggregated with millions of others.
The first utility-scale solar power plant was built in 1982 in Hesperia, California by ARCO",Renewable Energy
The plant was not profitable and was sold eight years later,Renewable Energy
"However, over the following decades, PV cells became significantly more efficient and cheaper",Renewable Energy
"As a result, PV adoption has grown exponentially since 2010",Renewable Energy
Global capacity increased from 230 GW at the end of 2015 to 890 GW in 2021,Renewable Energy
"PV grew fastest in China between 2016 and 2021, adding 560 GW, more than all advanced economies combined",Renewable Energy
"Four of the ten biggest solar power stations are in China, including the biggest, Golmud Solar Park in China.


==== Solar thermal ====

Unlike photovoltaic cells that convert sunlight directly into electricity, solar thermal systems convert it into heat",Renewable Energy
"They use mirrors or lenses to concentrate sunlight onto a receiver, which in turn heats a water reservoir",Renewable Energy
"The advantage of solar thermal is that the heated water can be stored until it is needed, eliminating the need for a separate energy storage system",Renewable Energy
Solar thermal power can also be converted to electricity by using the steam generated from the heated water to drive a turbine connected to a generator,Renewable Energy
"However, because generating electricity this way is much more expensive than photovoltaic power plants, there are very few in use today.


=== Wind power ===

Humans have harnessed wind energy since at least 3500 BC",Renewable Energy
"Until the 20th century, it was primarily used to power ships, windmills and water pumps",Renewable Energy
"Today, the vast majority of wind power is used to generate electricity using wind turbines",Renewable Energy
Modern utility-scale wind turbines range from around 600 kW to 9 MW of rated power,Renewable Energy
"The power available from the wind is a function of the cube of the wind speed, so as wind speed increases, power output increases up to the maximum output for the particular turbine",Renewable Energy
"Areas where winds are stronger and more constant, such as offshore and high-altitude sites, are preferred locations for wind farms.
Wind-generated electricity met nearly 4% of global electricity demand in 2015, with nearly 63 GW of new wind power capacity installed",Renewable Energy
"Wind energy was the leading source of new capacity in Europe, the US and Canada, and the second largest in China",Renewable Energy
"In Denmark, wind energy met more than 40% of its electricity demand while Ireland, Portugal and Spain each met nearly 20%.
Globally, the long-term technical potential of wind energy is believed to be five times total current global energy production, or 40 times current electricity demand, assuming all practical barriers needed were overcome",Renewable Energy
"This would require wind turbines to be installed over large areas, particularly in areas of higher wind resources, such as offshore, and likely also industrial use of new types of VAWT turbines in addition to the horizontal axis units currently in use",Renewable Energy
"As offshore wind speeds average ~90% greater than that of land, offshore resources can contribute substantially more energy than land-stationed turbines.
Investments in wind technologies reached USD 161 billion in 2020, with onshore wind dominating at 80% of total investments from 2013 to 2022",Renewable Energy
"Offshore wind investments nearly doubled to USD 41 billion between 2019 and 2020, primarily due to policy incentives in China and expansion in Europe",Renewable Energy
"Global wind capacity increased by 557 GW between 2013 and 2021, with capacity additions increasing by an average of 19% each year.


=== Hydropower ===

Since water is about 800 times denser than air, even a slow flowing stream of water, or moderate sea swell, can yield considerable amounts of energy",Renewable Energy
"Water can generate electricity with a conversion efficiency of about 90%, which is the highest rate in renewable energy",Renewable Energy
"There are many forms of water energy:

Historically, hydroelectric power came from constructing large hydroelectric dams and reservoirs, which are still popular in developing countries",Renewable Energy
"The largest of them are the Three Gorges Dam (2003) in China and the Itaipu Dam (1984) built by Brazil and Paraguay.
Small hydro systems are hydroelectric power installations that typically produce up to 50 MW of power",Renewable Energy
They are often used on small rivers or as a low-impact development on larger rivers,Renewable Energy
"China is the largest producer of hydroelectricity in the world and has more than 45,000 small hydro installations.
Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity plants derive energy from rivers without the creation of a large reservoir",Renewable Energy
"The water is typically conveyed along the side of the river valley (using channels, pipes and/or tunnels) until it is high above the valley floor, whereupon it can be allowed to fall through a penstock to drive a turbine",Renewable Energy
"A run-of-river plant may still produce a large amount of electricity, such as the Chief Joseph Dam on the Columbia River in the United States",Renewable Energy
"However many run-of-the-river hydro power plants are micro hydro or pico hydro plants.
Much hydropower is flexible, thus complementing wind and solar",Renewable Energy
"In 2021, the world renewable hydropower capacity was 1,360 GW",Renewable Energy
"Only a third of the world's estimated hydroelectric potential of 14,000 TWh/year has been developed",Renewable Energy
"New hydropower projects face opposition from local communities due to their large impact, including relocation of communities and flooding of wildlife habitats and farming land",Renewable Energy
"High cost and lead times from permission process, including environmental and risk assessments, with lack of environmental and social acceptance are therefore the primary challenges for new developments",Renewable Energy
It is popular to repower old dams thereby increasing their efficiency and capacity as well as quicker responsiveness on the grid,Renewable Energy
"Where circumstances permit existing dams such as the Russell Dam built in 1985 may be updated with ""pump back"" facilities for pumped-storage which is useful for peak loads or to support intermittent wind and solar power",Renewable Energy
"Because dispatchable power is more valuable than VRE countries with large hydroelectric developments such as Canada and Norway are spending billions to expand their grids to trade with neighboring countries having limited hydro.


=== Bioenergy ===

Biomass is biological material derived from living, or recently living organisms",Renewable Energy
"As an energy source, biomass can either be used directly via combustion to produce heat, or converted to a more energy-dense biofuel like ethanol",Renewable Energy
Wood is the most significant biomass energy source as of 2012 and is usually sourced from a trees cleared for silvicultural reasons or fire prevention,Renewable Energy
"Municipal wood waste – for instance, construction materials or sawdust – is also often burned for energy",Renewable Energy
"The biggest per-capita producers of wood-based bioenergy are heavily forested countries like Finland, Sweden, Estonia, Austria, and Denmark.
Bioenergy can be environmentally destructive if old-growth forests are cleared to make way for crop production",Renewable Energy
"In particular, demand for palm oil to produce biodiesel has contributed to the deforestation of tropical rainforests in Brazil and Indonesia",Renewable Energy
"In addition, burning biomass still produces carbon emissions, although much less than fossil fuels (39 grams of CO2 per megajoule of energy, compared to 75 g/MJ for fossil fuels).

Some biomass sources are unsustainable at current rates of exploitation (as of 2017).


==== Biofuel ====

Biofuels are primarily used in transportation, providing 3.5% of the world's transport energy demand in 2022, up from 2.7% in 2010",Renewable Energy
"Biojet is expected to be important for short-term reduction of carbon dioxide emissions from long-haul flights.
Aside from wood, the major sources of bioenergy are bioethanol and biodiesel",Renewable Energy
"Bioethanol is usually produced by fermenting the sugar components of crops like sugarcane and maize, while biodiesel is mostly made from oils extracted from plants, such as soybean oil and corn oil",Renewable Energy
"Most of the crops used to produce bioethanol and biodiesel are grown specifically for this purpose, although used cooking oil accounted for 14% of the oil used to produce biodiesel as of 2015",Renewable Energy
"Maize is the major feedstock in the United States, while sugarcane dominates in Brazil",Renewable Energy
"In the European Union, where biodiesel is more common than bioethanol, rapeseed oil and palm oil are the main feedstocks",Renewable Energy
"China, although it produces comparatively much less biofuel, uses mostly corn and wheat",Renewable Energy
"In many countries, biofuels are either subsidized or mandated to be included in fuel mixtures.

There are many other sources of bioenergy that are more niche, or not yet viable at large scales",Renewable Energy
"For instance, bioethanol could be produced from the cellulosic parts of crops, rather than only the seed as is common today",Renewable Energy
"Sweet sorghum may be a promising alternative source of bioethanol, due to its tolerance of a wide range of climates",Renewable Energy
"There is also a great deal of research involving algal fuel, which is attractive because algae is a non-food resource, grows around 20 times faster than most food crops, and can be grown almost anywhere.


=== Geothermal energy ===

Geothermal energy is thermal energy (heat) extracted from the Earth's crust",Renewable Energy
"It originates from several different sources, of which the most significant is slow radioactive decay of minerals contained in the Earth's interior, as well as some leftover heat from the formation of the Earth",Renewable Energy
"Some of the heat is generated near the Earth's surface in the crust, but some also flows from deep within the Earth from the mantle and core",Renewable Energy
"Geothermal energy extraction is viable mostly in countries located on tectonic plate edges, where the Earth's hot mantle is more exposed",Renewable Energy
"As of 2023, the United States has by far the most geothermal capacity (2.7 GW, or less than 0.2% of the country's total energy capacity), followed by Indonesia and the Philippines",Renewable Energy
"Global capacity in 2022 was 15 GW.
Geothermal energy can be either used directly to heat homes, as is common in Iceland, or to generate electricity",Renewable Energy
"At smaller scales, geothermal power can be generated with geothermal heat pumps, which can extract heat from ground temperatures of under 30 °C (86 °F), allowing them to be used at relatively shallow depths of a few meters",Renewable Energy
Electricity generation requires large plants and ground temperatures of at least 150 °C (302 °F),Renewable Energy
"In some countries, electricity produced from geothermal energy accounts for a large portion of the total, such as Kenya (43%) and Indonesia (5%).
Technical advances may eventually make geothermal power more widely available",Renewable Energy
"For example, enhanced geothermal systems involve drilling around 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) into the Earth, breaking apart hot rocks and extracting the heat using water",Renewable Energy
"In theory, this type of geothermal energy extraction could be done anywhere on Earth.


== Emerging technologies ==
There are also other renewable energy technologies that are still under development, including enhanced geothermal systems, concentrated solar power, cellulosic ethanol, and marine energy",Renewable Energy
These technologies are not yet widely demonstrated or have limited commercialization,Renewable Energy
"Some may have potential comparable to other renewable energy technologies, but still depend on further breakthroughs from research, development and engineering.


=== Enhanced geothermal systems ===

Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) are a new type of geothermal power which does not require natural hot water reservoirs or steam to generate power",Renewable Energy
"Most of the underground heat within drilling reach is trapped in solid rocks, not in water",Renewable Energy
"EGS technologies use hydraulic fracturing to break apart these rocks and release the heat they contain, which is then harvested by pumping water into the ground",Renewable Energy
"The process is sometimes known as ""hot dry rock"" (HDR)",Renewable Energy
"Unlike conventional geothermal energy extraction, EGS may be feasible anywhere in the world, depending on the cost of drilling",Renewable Energy
"EGS projects have so far primarily been limited to demonstration plants, as the technology is capital-intensive due to the high cost of drilling.


=== Marine energy ===

Marine energy (also sometimes referred to as ocean energy) is the energy carried by ocean waves, tides, salinity, and ocean temperature differences",Renewable Energy
"Technologies to harness the energy of moving water include wave power, marine current power, and tidal power",Renewable Energy
Reverse electrodialysis (RED) is a technology for generating electricity by mixing fresh water and salty sea water in large power cells,Renewable Energy
Most marine energy harvesting technologies are still at low technology readiness levels and not used at large scales,Renewable Energy
"Tidal energy is generally considered the most mature, but has not seen wide deployment",Renewable Energy
"The world's largest tidal power station is on Sihwa Lake, South Korea, which produces around 550 gigawatt-hours of electricity per year.


=== Earth infrared thermal radiation ===
Earth emits roughly 1017 W of infrared thermal radiation that flows toward the cold outer space",Renewable Energy
Solar energy hits the surface and atmosphere of the earth and produces heat,Renewable Energy
"Using various theorized devices like emissive energy harvester (EEH) or thermoradiative diode, this energy flow can be converted into electricity",Renewable Energy
"In theory, this technology can be used during nighttime.


=== Others ===


==== Algae fuels ====

Producing liquid fuels from oil-rich (fat-rich) varieties of algae is an ongoing research topic",Renewable Energy
"Various microalgae grown in open or closed systems are being tried including some systems that can be set up in brownfield and desert lands.


==== Space-based solar power ====

There have been numerous proposals for space-based solar power, in which very large satellites with photovoltaic panels would be equipped with microwave transmitters to beam power back to terrestrial receivers",Renewable Energy
"A 2024 study by the NASA Office of Science and Technology Policy examined the concept and concluded that with current and near-future technologies it would be economically uncompetitive.


==== Water vapor ====
Collection of static electricity charges from water droplets on metal surfaces is an experimental technology that would be especially useful in low-income countries with relative air humidity over 60%.


==== Nuclear energy ====
Breeder reactors could, in principle, depending on the fuel cycle employed, extract almost all of the energy contained in uranium or thorium, decreasing fuel requirements by a factor of 100 compared to widely used once-through light water reactors, which extract less than 1% of the energy in the actinide metal (uranium or thorium) mined from the earth",Renewable Energy
"The high fuel-efficiency of breeder reactors could greatly reduce concerns about fuel supply, energy used in mining, and storage of radioactive waste",Renewable Energy
"With seawater uranium extraction (currently too expensive to be economical), there is enough fuel for breeder reactors to satisfy the world's energy needs for 5 billion years at 1983's total energy consumption rate, thus making nuclear energy effectively a renewable energy",Renewable Energy
"In addition to seawater the average crustal granite rocks contain significant quantities of uranium and thorium with which breeder reactors can supply abundant energy for the remaining lifespan of the sun on the main sequence of stellar evolution.


==== Artificial photosynthesis ====

Artificial photosynthesis uses techniques including nanotechnology to store solar electromagnetic energy in chemical bonds by splitting water to produce hydrogen and then using carbon dioxide to make methanol",Renewable Energy
"Researchers in this field strived to design molecular mimics of photosynthesis that use a wider region of the solar spectrum, employ catalytic systems made from abundant, inexpensive materials that are robust, readily repaired, non-toxic, stable in a variety of environmental conditions and perform more efficiently allowing a greater proportion of photon energy to end up in the storage compounds, i.e., carbohydrates (rather than building and sustaining living cells)",Renewable Energy
"However, prominent research faces hurdles, Sun Catalytix a MIT spin-off stopped scaling up their prototype fuel-cell in 2012 because it offers few savings over other ways to make hydrogen from sunlight.


== Market and industry trends ==

Most new renewables are solar, followed by wind then hydro then bioenergy",Renewable Energy
"Investment in renewables, especially solar, tends to be more effective in creating jobs than coal, gas or oil",Renewable Energy
"Worldwide, renewables employ about 12 million people as of 2020, with solar PV being the technology employing the most at almost 4 million",Renewable Energy
"However, as of February 2024, the world's supply of workforce for solar energy is lagging greatly behind demand as universities worldwide still produce more workforce for fossil fuels than for renewable energy industries.
In 2021, China accounted for almost half of the global increase in renewable electricity.
There are 3,146 gigawatts installed in 135 countries, while 156 countries have laws regulating the renewable energy sector.
Globally in 2020 there are over 10 million jobs associated with the renewable energy industries, with solar photovoltaics being the largest renewable employer",Renewable Energy
"The clean energy sectors added about 4.7 million jobs globally between 2019 and 2022, totaling 35 million jobs by 2022.: 5 


=== Usage by sector or application ===
Some studies say that a global transition to 100% renewable energy across all sectors – power, heat, transport and industry – is feasible and economically viable.
One of the efforts to decarbonize transportation is the increased use of electric vehicles (EVs)",Renewable Energy
"Despite that and the use of biofuels, such as biojet, less than 4% of transport energy is from renewables",Renewable Energy
"Meanwhile, in the future electrofuels may also play a greater role in decarbonizing hard-to-abate sectors like aviation and maritime shipping.
Solar water heating makes an important contribution to renewable heat in many countries, most notably in China, which now has 70% of the global total (180 GWth)",Renewable Energy
Most of these systems are installed on multi-family apartment buildings and meet a portion of the hot water needs of an estimated 50–60 million households in China,Renewable Energy
"Worldwide, total installed solar water heating systems meet a portion of the water heating needs of over 70 million households.
Heat pumps provide both heating and cooling, and also flatten the electric demand curve and are thus an increasing priority",Renewable Energy
"About 10% of heating and cooling energy is from renewables.


=== Cost comparison ===
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) stated that ~86% (187 GW) of renewable capacity added in 2022 had lower costs than electricity generated from fossil fuels",Renewable Energy
"IRENA also stated that capacity added since 2000 reduced electricity bills in 2022 by at least $520 billion, and that in non-OECD countries, the lifetime savings of 2022 capacity additions will reduce costs by up to $580 billion.

* = 2018",Renewable Energy
"All other values for 2019.


=== Growth of renewables ===

The results of a recent review of the literature concluded that as greenhouse gas (GHG) emitters begin to be held liable for damages resulting from GHG emissions resulting in climate change, a high value for liability mitigation would provide powerful incentives for deployment of renewable energy technologies.
In the decade of 2010–2019, worldwide investment in renewable energy capacity excluding large hydropower amounted to US$2.7 trillion, of which the top countries China contributed US$818 billion, the United States contributed US$392.3 billion, Japan contributed US$210.9 billion, Germany contributed US$183.4 billion, and the United Kingdom contributed US$126.5 billion",Renewable Energy
"This was an increase of over three and possibly four times the equivalent amount invested in the decade of 2000–2009 (no data is available for 2000–2003).
As of 2022, an estimated 28% of the world's electricity was generated by renewables",Renewable Energy
"This is up from 19% in 1990.


==== Future projections ====

A December 2022 report by the IEA forecasts that over 2022-2027, renewables are seen growing by almost 2 400 GW in its main forecast, equal to the entire installed power capacity of China in 2021",Renewable Energy
"This is an 85% acceleration from the previous five years, and almost 30% higher than what the IEA forecast in its 2021 report, making its largest ever upward revision",Renewable Energy
Renewables are set to account for over 90% of global electricity capacity expansion over the forecast period,Renewable Energy
"To achieve net zero emissions by 2050, IEA believes that 90% of global electricity generation will need to be produced from renewable sources.
In June 2022 IEA Executive Director Fatih Birol said that countries should invest more in renewables to ""ease the pressure on consumers from high fossil fuel prices, make our energy systems more secure, and get the world on track to reach our climate goals.""
China's five year plan to 2025 includes increasing direct heating by renewables such as geothermal and solar thermal.
REPowerEU, the EU plan to escape dependence on fossil Russian gas, is expected to call for much more green hydrogen.
After a transitional period, renewable energy production is expected to make up most of the world's energy production",Renewable Energy
"In 2018, the risk management firm, DNV GL, forecasts that the world's primary energy mix will be split equally between fossil and non-fossil sources by 2050.
Middle eastern nations are also  planning on reducing their reliance fossil fuel",Renewable Energy
"Many planned green projects will contribute in 26% of energy supply for the region by 2050 achieving emission reductions equal to 1.1 Gt CO2/year.
Massive Renewable Energy Projects in the Middle East:

Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park in Duba, UAE
Shuaibah Two (2) Solar Facility in Mecca Province, Saudi Arabia
NEOM Green Hydrogen Project in NEOM, Saudi Arabia
Gulf of Suez Wind Power Project in Suez, Egypt
Al-Ajban Solar Park in Abu Dhabi, UAE


=== Demand ===
In July 2014, WWF and the World Resources Institute convened a discussion among a number of major US companies who had declared their intention to increase their use of renewable energy",Renewable Energy
"These discussions identified a number of ""principles"" which companies seeking greater access to renewable energy considered important market deliverables",Renewable Energy
"These principles included choice (between suppliers and between products), cost competitiveness, longer term fixed price supplies, access to third-party financing vehicles, and collaboration.
UK statistics released in September 2020 noted that ""the proportion of demand met from renewables varies from a low of 3.4 per cent (for transport, mainly from biofuels) to highs of over 20 per cent for 'other final users', which is largely the service and commercial sectors that consume relatively large quantities of electricity, and industry"".
In some locations, individual households can opt to purchase renewable energy through a consumer green energy program.


=== Developing countries ===

In Kenya, the Olkaria V Geothermal Power Station is one of the largest in the world",Renewable Energy
"Once completed, Morocco's Ouarzazate Solar Power Station is projected to provide power to over a million people.


== Policy ==

Policies to support renewable energy have been vital in their expansion",Renewable Energy
"Where Europe dominated in establishing energy policy in the early 2000s, most countries around the world now have some form of energy policy.
The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) is an intergovernmental organization for promoting the adoption of renewable energy worldwide",Renewable Energy
It aims to provide concrete policy advice and facilitate capacity building and technology transfer,Renewable Energy
"IRENA was formed in 2009, with 75 countries signing the charter of IRENA",Renewable Energy
"The then United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon has said that renewable energy can lift the poorest nations to new levels of prosperity, and in September 2011 he launched the UN Sustainable Energy for All initiative to improve energy access, efficiency and the deployment of renewable energy.
The 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change motivated many countries to develop or improve renewable energy policies",Renewable Energy
"In 2017, a total of 121 countries adopted some form of renewable energy policy",Renewable Energy
"In addition, there is also a wide range of policies at the state/provincial, and local levels",Renewable Energy
"Some public utilities help plan or install residential energy upgrades.
Many national, state and local governments have created green banks",Renewable Energy
A green bank is a quasi-public financial institution that uses public capital to leverage private investment in clean energy technologies,Renewable Energy
"Green banks use a variety of financial tools to bridge market gaps that hinder the deployment of clean energy.
Global and national policies related to renewable energy can be divided based on sectors, such as agriculture, transport, buildings, industry:
Climate neutrality (net zero emissions) by the year 2050 is the main goal of the European Green Deal",Renewable Energy
"For the European Union to reach their target of climate neutrality, one goal is to decarbonise its energy system by aiming to achieve ""net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.""


== Finance ==
The International Renewable Energy Agency's (IRENA) 2023 report on renewable energy finance highlights steady investment growth since 2018: USD 348 billion in 2020 (a 5.6% increase from 2019), USD 430 billion in 2021 (24% up from 2020), and USD 499 billion in 2022 (16% higher)",Renewable Energy
"This trend is driven by increasing recognition of renewable energy's role in mitigating climate change and enhancing energy security, along with investor interest in alternatives to fossil fuels",Renewable Energy
Policies such as feed-in tariffs in China and Vietnam have significantly increased renewable adoption,Renewable Energy
"Furthermore, from 2013 to 2022, installation costs for solar photovoltaic (PV), onshore wind, and offshore wind fell by 69%, 33%, and 45%, respectively, making renewables more cost-effective.
Between 2013 and 2022, the renewable energy sector underwent a significant realignment of investment priorities",Renewable Energy
"In contrast, other renewable technologies such as hydropower (including pumped storage hydropower), biomass, biofuels, geothermal, and marine energy experienced a substantial decrease in financial investment",Renewable Energy
"Notably, from 2017 to 2022, investment in these alternative renewable technologies declined by 45%, falling from USD 35 billion to USD 17 billion.
In 2023, the renewable energy sector experienced a significant surge in investments, particularly in solar and wind technologies, totaling approximately USD 200 billion—a 75% increase from the previous year",Renewable Energy
"The increased investments in 2023 contributed between 1% and 4% to the GDP in key regions including the United States, China, the European Union, and India.
The energy sector receives investments of approximately USD 3 trillion each year, with USD 1.9 trillion directed towards clean energy technologies and infrastructure",Renewable Energy
"To meet the targets set in the Net Zero Emissions (NZE) Scenario by 2035, this investment must increase to USD 5.3 trillion per year.: 15 


== Debates ==


=== Nuclear power proposed as renewable energy ===


=== Geopolitics ===

The geopolitical impact of the growing use of renewable energy is a subject of ongoing debate and research",Renewable Energy
"Many fossil-fuel producing countries, such as Qatar, Russia, Saudi Arabia and Norway, are currently able to exert diplomatic or geopolitical influence as a result of their oil wealth",Renewable Energy
"Most of these countries are expected to be among the geopolitical ""losers"" of the energy transition, although some, like Norway, are also significant producers and exporters of renewable energy",Renewable Energy
"Fossil fuels and the infrastructure to extract them may, in the long term, become stranded assets",Renewable Energy
"It has been speculated that countries dependent on fossil fuel revenue may one day find it in their interests to quickly sell off their remaining fossil fuels.
Conversely, nations abundant in renewable resources, and the minerals required for renewables technology, are expected to gain influence",Renewable Energy
"In particular, China has become the world's dominant manufacturer of the technology needed to produce or store renewable energy, especially solar panels, wind turbines, and lithium-ion batteries",Renewable Energy
Nations rich in solar and wind energy could become major energy exporters,Renewable Energy
"Some may produce and export green hydrogen, although electricity is projected to be the dominant energy carrier in 2050, accounting for almost 50% of total energy consumption (up from 22% in 2015)",Renewable Energy
"Countries with large uninhabited areas such as Australia, China, and many African and Middle Eastern countries have a potential for huge installations of renewable energy",Renewable Energy
"The production of renewable energy technologies requires rare-earth elements with new supply chains.
Countries with already weak governments that rely on fossil fuel revenue may face even higher political instability or popular unrest",Renewable Energy
"Analysts consider Nigeria, Angola, Chad, Gabon, and Sudan, all countries with a history of military coups, to be at risk of instability due to dwindling oil income.
A study found that transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy systems reduces risks from mining, trade and political dependence because renewable energy systems don't need fuel – they depend on trade only for the acquisition of materials and components during construction.
In October 2021, European Commissioner for Climate Action Frans Timmermans suggested ""the best answer"" to the 2021 global energy crisis is ""to reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" He said those blaming the European Green Deal were doing so ""for perhaps ideological reasons or sometimes economic reasons in protecting their vested interests."" Some critics blamed the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS) and closure of nuclear plants for contributing to the energy crisis",Renewable Energy
"European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said that Europe is ""too reliant"" on natural gas and too dependent on natural gas imports",Renewable Energy
"According to Von der Leyen, ""The answer has to do with diversifying our suppliers ..",Renewable Energy
"and, crucially, with speeding up the transition to clean energy.""


=== Metal and mineral extraction ===

The transition to renewable energy requires increased extraction of certain metals and minerals",Renewable Energy
"Like all mining, this impacts the environment and can lead to environmental conflict",Renewable Energy
"Wind power requires large amounts of copper and zinc, as well as smaller amounts of the rarer metal neodymium",Renewable Energy
"Solar power is less resource-intensive, but still requires significant amounts of aluminum",Renewable Energy
The expansion of electrical grids requires both copper and aluminum,Renewable Energy
"Batteries, which are critical to enable storage of renewable energy, use large quantities of copper, nickel, aluminum and graphite",Renewable Energy
Demand for lithium is expected to grow 42-fold from 2020 to 2040,Renewable Energy
"Demand for nickel, cobalt and graphite is expected to grow by a factor of about 20–25",Renewable Energy
"For each of the most relevant minerals and metals, its mining is dominated by a single country: copper in Chile, nickel in Indonesia, rare earths in China, cobalt in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and lithium in Australia",Renewable Energy
"China dominates processing of all of these.
Recycling these metals after the devices they are embedded in are spent is essential to create a circular economy and ensure renewable energy is sustainable",Renewable Energy
"By 2040, recycled copper, lithium, cobalt, and nickel from spent batteries could reduce combined primary supply requirements for these minerals by around 10%.
A controversial approach is deep sea mining",Renewable Energy
Minerals can be collected from new sources like polymetallic nodules lying on the seabed,Renewable Energy
"This would damage local biodiversity, but proponents point out that biomass on resource-rich seabeds is much scarcer than in the mining regions on land, which are often found in vulnerable habitats like rainforests.
Due to co-occurrence of rare-earth and radioactive elements (thorium, uranium and radium), rare-earth mining results in production of low-level radioactive waste",Renewable Energy
"In several African countries, the green energy transition has created a mining boom, causing deforestation, and threatening already endangered species.


=== Conservation areas ===
Installations used to produce wind, solar and hydropower are an increasing threat to key conservation areas, with facilities built in areas set aside for nature conservation and other environmentally sensitive areas",Renewable Energy
"They are often much larger than fossil fuel power plants, needing areas of land up to 10 times greater than coal or gas to produce equivalent energy amounts",Renewable Energy
"More than 2000 renewable energy facilities are built, and more are under construction, in areas of environmental importance and threaten the habitats of plant and animal species across the globe",Renewable Energy
The authors' team emphasized that their work should not be interpreted as anti-renewables because renewable energy is crucial for reducing carbon emissions,Renewable Energy
"The key is ensuring that renewable energy facilities are built in places where they do not damage biodiversity.
In 2020 scientists published a world map of areas that contain renewable energy materials as well as estimations of their overlaps with ""Key Biodiversity Areas"", ""Remaining Wilderness"" and ""Protected Areas""",Renewable Energy
"The authors assessed that careful strategic planning is needed.


=== Recycling of solar panels ===
Solar panels are recycled to reduce electronic waste and create a source for materials that would otherwise need to be mined, but such business is still small and work is ongoing to improve and scale-up the process.


== Society and culture ==


=== Public support ===

Solar power plants may compete with arable land, while on-shore wind farms often face opposition due to aesthetic concerns and noise",Renewable Energy
"Such opponents are often described as NIMBYs (""not in my back yard"")",Renewable Energy
Some environmentalists are concerned about fatal collisions of birds and bats with wind turbines,Renewable Energy
"Although protests against new wind farms occasionally occur around the world, regional and national surveys generally find broad support for both solar and wind power.
Community-owned wind energy is sometimes proposed as a way to increase local support for wind farms",Renewable Energy
"A 2011 UK Government document stated that ""projects are generally more likely to succeed if they have broad public support and the consent of local communities",Renewable Energy
"This means giving communities both a say and a stake."" In the 2000s and early 2010s, many renewable projects in Germany, Sweden and Denmark were owned by local communities, particularly through cooperative structures",Renewable Energy
"In the years since, more installations in Germany have been undertaken by large companies, but community ownership remains strong in Denmark.


== History ==

Prior to the development of coal in the mid 19th century, nearly all energy used was renewable",Renewable Energy
"The oldest known use of renewable energy, in the form of traditional biomass to fuel fires, dates from more than a million years ago",Renewable Energy
The use of biomass for fire did not become commonplace until many hundreds of thousands of years later,Renewable Energy
Probably the second oldest usage of renewable energy is harnessing the wind in order to drive ships over water,Renewable Energy
"This practice can be traced back some 7000 years, to ships in the Persian Gulf and on the Nile",Renewable Energy
"From hot springs, geothermal energy has been used for bathing since Paleolithic times and for space heating since ancient Roman times",Renewable Energy
"Moving into the time of recorded history, the primary sources of traditional renewable energy were human labor, animal power, water power, wind, in grain crushing windmills, and firewood, a traditional biomass.
In 1885, Werner Siemens, commenting on the discovery of the photovoltaic effect in the solid state, wrote:

In conclusion, I would say that however great the scientific importance of this discovery may be, its practical value will be no less obvious when we reflect that the supply of solar energy is both without limit and without cost, and that it will continue to pour down upon us for countless ages after all the coal deposits of the earth have been exhausted and forgotten.
Max Weber mentioned the end of fossil fuel in the concluding paragraphs of his Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism), published in 1905",Renewable Energy
Development of solar engines continued until the outbreak of World War I,Renewable Energy
"The importance of solar energy was recognized in a 1911 Scientific American article: ""in the far distant future, natural fuels having been exhausted [solar power] will remain as the only means of existence of the human race"".
The theory of peak oil was published in 1956",Renewable Energy
"In the 1970s environmentalists promoted the development of renewable energy both as a replacement for the eventual depletion of oil, as well as for an escape from dependence on oil, and the first electricity-generating wind turbines appeared",Renewable Energy
"Solar had long been used for heating and cooling, but solar panels were too costly to build solar farms until 1980.
New government spending, regulation and policies helped the renewables industry weather the 2009 global financial crisis better than many other sectors",Renewable Energy
"In 2022, renewables accounted for 30% of global electricity generation, up from 21% in 1985.

Renewable Energy Conference – a global platform for industry professionals, academics, and policymakers to exchange knowledge and discuss advancements in renewable energy technologies, with a focus on innovation, sustainability, and future energy solutions.",Renewable Energy
"Artificial intelligence (AI), in its broadest sense, is intelligence exhibited by machines, particularly computer systems",Artificial Intelligence
It is a field of research in computer science that develops and studies methods and software that enable machines to perceive their environment and use learning and intelligence to take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals,Artificial Intelligence
"Such machines may be called AIs.
Some high-profile applications of AI include advanced web search engines (e.g., Google Search); recommendation systems (used by YouTube, Amazon, and Netflix); interacting via human speech (e.g., Google Assistant, Siri, and Alexa); autonomous vehicles (e.g., Waymo); generative and creative tools (e.g., ChatGPT, and AI art); and superhuman play and analysis in strategy games (e.g., chess and Go)",Artificial Intelligence
"However, many AI applications are not perceived as AI: ""A lot of cutting edge AI has filtered into general applications, often without being called AI because once something becomes useful enough and common enough it's not labeled AI anymore.""
The various subfields of AI research are centered around particular goals and the use of particular tools",Artificial Intelligence
"The traditional goals of AI research include reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, perception, and support for robotics",Artificial Intelligence
General intelligence—the ability to complete any task performable by a human on an at least equal level—is among the field's long-term goals,Artificial Intelligence
"To reach these goals, AI researchers have adapted and integrated a wide range of techniques, including search and mathematical optimization, formal logic, artificial neural networks, and methods based on statistics, operations research, and economics",Artificial Intelligence
"AI also draws upon psychology, linguistics, philosophy, neuroscience, and other fields.
Artificial intelligence was founded as an academic discipline in 1956, and the field went through multiple cycles of optimism, followed by periods of disappointment and loss of funding, known as AI winter",Artificial Intelligence
Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning outperformed previous AI techniques,Artificial Intelligence
"This growth accelerated further after 2017 with the transformer architecture, and by the early 2020s hundreds of billions of dollars were being invested in AI (known as the ""AI boom"")",Artificial Intelligence
"The widespread use of AI in the 21st century exposed several unintended consequences and harms in the present and raised concerns about its risks and long-term effects in the future, prompting discussions about regulatory policies to ensure the safety and benefits of the technology.


== Goals ==
The general problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been broken into subproblems",Artificial Intelligence
These consist of particular traits or capabilities that researchers expect an intelligent system to display,Artificial Intelligence
"The traits described below have received the most attention and cover the scope of AI research.


=== Reasoning and problem-solving ===
Early researchers developed algorithms that imitated step-by-step reasoning that humans use when they solve puzzles or make logical deductions",Artificial Intelligence
"By the late 1980s and 1990s, methods were developed for dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, employing concepts from probability and economics.
Many of these algorithms are insufficient for solving large reasoning problems because they experience a ""combinatorial explosion"": They become exponentially slower as the problems grow",Artificial Intelligence
Even humans rarely use the step-by-step deduction that early AI research could model,Artificial Intelligence
"They solve most of their problems using fast, intuitive judgments",Artificial Intelligence
"Accurate and efficient reasoning is an unsolved problem.


=== Knowledge representation ===

Knowledge representation and knowledge engineering allow AI programs to answer questions intelligently and make deductions about real-world facts",Artificial Intelligence
"Formal knowledge representations are used in content-based indexing and retrieval, scene interpretation, clinical decision support, knowledge discovery (mining ""interesting"" and actionable inferences from large databases), and other areas.
A knowledge base is a body of knowledge represented in a form that can be used by a program",Artificial Intelligence
"An ontology is the set of objects, relations, concepts, and properties used by a particular domain of knowledge",Artificial Intelligence
"Knowledge bases need to represent things such as objects, properties, categories, and relations between objects; situations, events, states, and time; causes and effects; knowledge about knowledge (what we know about what other people know); default reasoning (things that humans assume are true until they are told differently and will remain true even when other facts are changing); and many other aspects and domains of knowledge.
Among the most difficult problems in knowledge representation are the breadth of commonsense knowledge (the set of atomic facts that the average person knows is enormous); and the sub-symbolic form of most commonsense knowledge (much of what people know is not represented as ""facts"" or ""statements"" that they could express verbally)",Artificial Intelligence
"There is also the difficulty of knowledge acquisition, the problem of obtaining knowledge for AI applications.


=== Planning and decision-making ===
An ""agent"" is anything that perceives and takes actions in the world",Artificial Intelligence
A rational agent has goals or preferences and takes actions to make them happen,Artificial Intelligence
"In automated decision-making, the agent has preferences—there are some situations it would prefer to be in, and some situations it is trying to avoid",Artificial Intelligence
"The decision-making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the ""utility"") that measures how much the agent prefers it",Artificial Intelligence
"For each possible action, it can calculate the ""expected utility"": the utility of all possible outcomes of the action, weighted by the probability that the outcome will occur",Artificial Intelligence
"It can then choose the action with the maximum expected utility.
In classical planning, the agent knows exactly what the effect of any action will be",Artificial Intelligence
"In most real-world problems, however, the agent may not be certain about the situation they are in (it is ""unknown"" or ""unobservable"") and it may not know for certain what will happen after each possible action (it is not ""deterministic"")",Artificial Intelligence
"It must choose an action by making a probabilistic guess and then reassess the situation to see if the action worked.
In some problems, the agent's preferences may be uncertain, especially if there are other agents or humans involved",Artificial Intelligence
"These can be learned (e.g., with inverse reinforcement learning), or the agent can seek information to improve its preferences",Artificial Intelligence
Information value theory can be used to weigh the value of exploratory or experimental actions,Artificial Intelligence
"The space of possible future actions and situations is typically intractably large, so the agents must take actions and evaluate situations while being uncertain of what the outcome will be.
A Markov decision process has a transition model that describes the probability that a particular action will change the state in a particular way and a reward function that supplies the utility of each state and the cost of each action",Artificial Intelligence
"The policy could be calculated (e.g., by iteration), be heuristic, or it can be learned.
Game theory describes the rational behavior of multiple interacting agents and is used in AI programs that make decisions that involve other agents.


=== Learning ===
Machine learning is the study of programs that can improve their performance on a given task automatically",Artificial Intelligence
"It has been a part of AI from the beginning.
There are several kinds of machine learning",Artificial Intelligence
Unsupervised learning analyzes a stream of data and finds patterns and makes predictions without any other guidance,Artificial Intelligence
"Supervised learning requires a human to label the input data first, and comes in two main varieties: classification (where the program must learn to predict what category the input belongs in) and regression (where the program must deduce a numeric function based on numeric input).
In reinforcement learning, the agent is rewarded for good responses and punished for bad ones",Artificial Intelligence
"The agent learns to choose responses that are classified as ""good""",Artificial Intelligence
Transfer learning is when the knowledge gained from one problem is applied to a new problem,Artificial Intelligence
"Deep learning is a type of machine learning that runs inputs through biologically inspired artificial neural networks for all of these types of learning.
Computational learning theory can assess learners by computational complexity, by sample complexity (how much data is required), or by other notions of optimization.


=== Natural language processing ===
Natural language processing (NLP) allows programs to read, write and communicate in human languages such as English",Artificial Intelligence
"Specific problems include speech recognition, speech synthesis, machine translation, information extraction, information retrieval and question answering.
Early work, based on Noam Chomsky's generative grammar and semantic networks, had difficulty with word-sense disambiguation unless restricted to small domains called ""micro-worlds"" (due to the common sense knowledge problem)",Artificial Intelligence
"Margaret Masterman believed that it was meaning and not grammar that was the key to understanding languages, and that thesauri and not dictionaries should be the basis of computational language structure.
Modern deep learning techniques for NLP include word embedding (representing words, typically as vectors encoding their meaning), transformers (a deep learning architecture using an attention mechanism), and others",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2019, generative pre-trained transformer (or ""GPT"") language models began to generate coherent text, and by 2023, these models were able to get human-level scores on the bar exam, SAT test, GRE test, and many other real-world applications.


=== Perception ===
Machine perception is the ability to use input from sensors (such as cameras, microphones, wireless signals, active lidar, sonar, radar, and tactile sensors) to deduce aspects of the world",Artificial Intelligence
"Computer vision is the ability to analyze visual input.
The field includes speech recognition, image classification, facial recognition, object recognition,object tracking, and robotic perception.


=== Social intelligence ===

Affective computing is an interdisciplinary umbrella that comprises systems that recognize, interpret, process, or simulate human feeling, emotion, and mood",Artificial Intelligence
"For example, some virtual assistants are programmed to speak conversationally or even to banter humorously; it makes them appear more sensitive to the emotional dynamics of human interaction, or to otherwise facilitate human–computer interaction.
However, this tends to give naïve users an unrealistic conception of the intelligence of existing computer agents",Artificial Intelligence
"Moderate successes related to affective computing include textual sentiment analysis and, more recently, multimodal sentiment analysis, wherein AI classifies the affects displayed by a videotaped subject.


=== General intelligence ===
A machine with artificial general intelligence should be able to solve a wide variety of problems with breadth and versatility similar to human intelligence.


== Techniques ==
AI research uses a wide variety of techniques to accomplish the goals above.


=== Search and optimization ===
AI can solve many problems by intelligently searching through many possible solutions",Artificial Intelligence
"There are two very different kinds of search used in AI: state space search and local search.


==== State space search ====
State space search searches through a tree of possible states to try to find a goal state",Artificial Intelligence
"For example, planning algorithms search through trees of goals and subgoals, attempting to find a path to a target goal, a process called means-ends analysis.
Simple exhaustive searches are rarely sufficient for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of places to search) quickly grows to astronomical numbers",Artificial Intelligence
The result is a search that is too slow or never completes,Artificial Intelligence
"""Heuristics"" or ""rules of thumb"" can help prioritize choices that are more likely to reach a goal.
Adversarial search is used for game-playing programs, such as chess or Go",Artificial Intelligence
"It searches through a tree of possible moves and counter-moves, looking for a winning position.


==== Local search ====
 Local search uses mathematical optimization to find a solution to a problem",Artificial Intelligence
"It begins with some form of guess and refines it incrementally.
Gradient descent is a type of local search that optimizes a set of numerical parameters by incrementally adjusting them to minimize a loss function",Artificial Intelligence
"Variants of gradient descent are commonly used to train neural networks.
Another type of local search is evolutionary computation, which aims to iteratively improve a set of candidate solutions by ""mutating"" and ""recombining"" them, selecting only the fittest to survive each generation.
Distributed search processes can coordinate via swarm intelligence algorithms",Artificial Intelligence
"Two popular swarm algorithms used in search are particle swarm optimization (inspired by bird flocking) and ant colony optimization (inspired by ant trails).


=== Logic ===
Formal logic is used for reasoning and knowledge representation.
Formal logic comes in two main forms: propositional logic (which operates on statements that are true or false and uses logical connectives such as ""and"", ""or"", ""not"" and ""implies"") and predicate logic (which also operates on objects, predicates and relations and uses quantifiers such as ""Every X is a Y"" and ""There are some Xs that are Ys"").
Deductive reasoning in logic is the process of proving a new statement (conclusion) from other statements that are given and assumed to be true (the premises)",Artificial Intelligence
"Proofs can be structured as proof trees, in which nodes are labelled by sentences, and children nodes are connected to parent nodes by inference rules.
Given a problem and a set of premises, problem-solving reduces to searching for a proof tree whose root node is labelled by a solution of the problem and whose leaf nodes are labelled by premises or axioms",Artificial Intelligence
"In the case of Horn clauses, problem-solving search can be performed by reasoning forwards from the premises or backwards from the problem",Artificial Intelligence
"In the more general case of the clausal form of first-order logic, resolution is a single, axiom-free rule of inference, in which a problem is solved by proving a contradiction from premises that include the negation of the problem to be solved.
Inference in both Horn clause logic and first-order logic is undecidable, and therefore intractable",Artificial Intelligence
"However, backward reasoning with Horn clauses, which underpins computation in the logic programming language Prolog, is Turing complete",Artificial Intelligence
"Moreover, its efficiency is competitive with computation in other symbolic programming languages.
Fuzzy logic assigns a ""degree of truth"" between 0 and 1",Artificial Intelligence
"It can therefore handle propositions that are vague and partially true.
Non-monotonic logics, including logic programming with negation as failure, are designed to handle default reasoning",Artificial Intelligence
"Other specialized versions of logic have been developed to describe many complex domains.


=== Probabilistic methods for uncertain reasoning ===

Many problems in AI (including in reasoning, planning, learning, perception, and robotics) require the agent to operate with incomplete or uncertain information",Artificial Intelligence
AI researchers have devised a number of tools to solve these problems using methods from probability theory and economics,Artificial Intelligence
"Precise mathematical tools have been developed that analyze how an agent can make choices and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory",Artificial Intelligence
"These tools include models such as Markov decision processes, dynamic decision networks, game theory and mechanism design.
Bayesian networks are a tool that can be used for reasoning (using the Bayesian inference algorithm), learning (using the expectation–maximization algorithm), planning (using decision networks) and perception (using dynamic Bayesian networks).
Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, prediction, smoothing, and finding explanations for streams of data, thus helping perception systems analyze processes that occur over time (e.g., hidden Markov models or Kalman filters).


=== Classifiers and statistical learning methods ===
The simplest AI applications can be divided into two types: classifiers (e.g., ""if shiny then diamond""), on one hand, and controllers (e.g., ""if diamond then pick up""), on the other hand",Artificial Intelligence
Classifiers are functions that use pattern matching to determine the closest match,Artificial Intelligence
They can be fine-tuned based on chosen examples using supervised learning,Artificial Intelligence
"Each pattern (also called an ""observation"") is labeled with a certain predefined class",Artificial Intelligence
All the observations combined with their class labels are known as a data set,Artificial Intelligence
"When a new observation is received, that observation is classified based on previous experience.
There are many kinds of classifiers in use",Artificial Intelligence
The decision tree is the simplest and most widely used symbolic machine learning algorithm,Artificial Intelligence
"K-nearest neighbor algorithm was the most widely used analogical AI until the mid-1990s, and Kernel methods such as the support vector machine (SVM) displaced k-nearest neighbor in the 1990s.
The naive Bayes classifier is reportedly the ""most widely used learner"" at Google, due in part to its scalability.
Neural networks are also used as classifiers.


=== Artificial neural networks ===

An artificial neural network is based on a collection of nodes also known as artificial neurons, which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain",Artificial Intelligence
"It is trained to recognise patterns; once trained, it can recognise those patterns in fresh data",Artificial Intelligence
"There is an input, at least one hidden layer of nodes and an output",Artificial Intelligence
"Each node applies a function and once the weight crosses its specified threshold, the data is transmitted to the next layer",Artificial Intelligence
"A network is typically called a deep neural network if it has at least 2 hidden layers.
Learning algorithms for neural networks use local search to choose the weights that will get the right output for each input during training",Artificial Intelligence
Neural networks learn to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs and find patterns in data,Artificial Intelligence
"In theory, a neural network can learn any function.
In feedforward neural networks the signal passes in only one direction",Artificial Intelligence
"Recurrent neural networks feed the output signal back into the input, which allows short-term memories of previous input events",Artificial Intelligence
Long short term memory is the most successful network architecture for recurrent networks,Artificial Intelligence
Perceptrons use only a single layer of neurons; deep learning uses multiple layers,Artificial Intelligence
"Convolutional neural networks strengthen the connection between neurons that are ""close"" to each other—this is especially important in image processing, where a local set of neurons must identify an ""edge"" before the network can identify an object.


=== Deep learning ===

Deep learning uses several layers of neurons between the network's inputs and outputs",Artificial Intelligence
The multiple layers can progressively extract higher-level features from the raw input,Artificial Intelligence
"For example, in image processing, lower layers may identify edges, while higher layers may identify the concepts relevant to a human such as digits, letters, or faces.
Deep learning has profoundly improved the performance of programs in many important subfields of artificial intelligence, including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, image classification, and others",Artificial Intelligence
The reason that deep learning performs so well in so many applications is not known as of 2023,Artificial Intelligence
"The sudden success of deep learning in 2012–2015 did not occur because of some new discovery or theoretical breakthrough (deep neural networks and backpropagation had been described by many people, as far back as the 1950s) but because of two factors: the incredible increase in computer power (including the hundred-fold increase in speed by switching to GPUs) and the availability of vast amounts of training data, especially the giant curated datasets used for benchmark testing, such as ImageNet.


=== GPT ===
Generative pre-trained transformers (GPT) are large language models (LLMs) that generate text based on the semantic relationships between words in sentences",Artificial Intelligence
Text-based GPT models are pretrained on a large corpus of text that can be from the Internet,Artificial Intelligence
"The pretraining consists of predicting the next token (a token being usually a word, subword, or punctuation)",Artificial Intelligence
"Throughout this pretraining, GPT models accumulate knowledge about the world and can then generate human-like text by repeatedly predicting the next token",Artificial Intelligence
"Typically, a subsequent training phase makes the model more truthful, useful, and harmless, usually with a technique called reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)",Artificial Intelligence
"Current GPT models are prone to generating falsehoods called ""hallucinations"", although this can be reduced with RLHF and quality data",Artificial Intelligence
"They are used in chatbots, which allow people to ask a question or request a task in simple text.
Current models and services include Gemini (formerly Bard), ChatGPT, Grok, Claude, Copilot, and LLaMA",Artificial Intelligence
"Multimodal GPT models can process different types of data (modalities) such as images, videos, sound, and text.


=== Hardware and software ===

In the late 2010s, graphics processing units (GPUs) that were increasingly designed with AI-specific enhancements and used with specialized TensorFlow software had replaced previously used central processing unit (CPUs) as the dominant means for large-scale (commercial and academic) machine learning models' training",Artificial Intelligence
"Specialized programming languages such as Prolog were used in early AI research, but general-purpose programming languages like Python have become predominant.
The transistor density in integrated circuits has been observed to roughly double every 18 months—a trend known as Moore's law, named after the Intel co-founder Gordon Moore, who first identified it",Artificial Intelligence
"Improvements in GPUs have been even faster.


== Applications ==
AI and machine learning technology is used in most of the essential applications of the 2020s, including: search engines (such as Google Search), targeting online advertisements, recommendation systems (offered by Netflix, YouTube or Amazon), driving internet traffic, targeted advertising (AdSense, Facebook), virtual assistants (such as Siri or Alexa), autonomous vehicles (including drones, ADAS and self-driving cars), automatic language translation (Microsoft Translator, Google Translate), facial recognition (Apple's Face ID or Microsoft's DeepFace and Google's FaceNet) and image labeling (used by Facebook, Apple's iPhoto and TikTok)",Artificial Intelligence
"The deployment of AI may be overseen by a Chief automation officer (CAO).


=== Health and medicine ===

The application of AI in medicine and medical research has the potential to increase patient care and quality of life",Artificial Intelligence
"Through the lens of the Hippocratic Oath, medical professionals are ethically compelled to use AI, if applications can more accurately diagnose and treat patients.
For medical research, AI is an important tool for processing and integrating big data",Artificial Intelligence
This is particularly important for organoid and tissue engineering development which use microscopy imaging as a key technique in fabrication,Artificial Intelligence
It has been suggested that AI can overcome discrepancies in funding allocated to different fields of research,Artificial Intelligence
New AI tools can deepen the understanding of biomedically relevant pathways,Artificial Intelligence
"For example, AlphaFold 2 (2021) demonstrated the ability to approximate, in hours rather than months, the 3D structure of a protein",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2023, it was reported that AI-guided drug discovery helped find a class of antibiotics capable of killing two different types of drug-resistant bacteria",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2024, researchers used machine learning to accelerate the search for Parkinson's disease drug treatments",Artificial Intelligence
"Their aim was to identify compounds that block the clumping, or aggregation, of alpha-synuclein (the protein that characterises Parkinson's disease)",Artificial Intelligence
"They were able to speed up the initial screening process ten-fold and reduce the cost by a thousand-fold.


=== Games ===

Game playing programs have been used since the 1950s to demonstrate and test AI's most advanced techniques",Artificial Intelligence
"Deep Blue became the first computer chess-playing system to beat a reigning world chess champion, Garry Kasparov, on 11 May 1997",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2011, in a Jeopardy! quiz show exhibition match, IBM's question answering system, Watson, defeated the two greatest Jeopardy! champions, Brad Rutter and Ken Jennings, by a significant margin",Artificial Intelligence
"In March 2016, AlphaGo won 4 out of 5 games of Go in a match with Go champion Lee Sedol, becoming the first computer Go-playing system to beat a professional Go player without handicaps",Artificial Intelligence
"Then, in 2017, it defeated Ke Jie, who was the best Go player in the world",Artificial Intelligence
"Other programs handle imperfect-information games, such as the poker-playing program Pluribus",Artificial Intelligence
"DeepMind developed increasingly generalistic reinforcement learning models, such as with MuZero, which could be trained to play chess, Go, or Atari games",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2019, DeepMind's AlphaStar achieved grandmaster level in StarCraft II, a particularly challenging real-time strategy game that involves incomplete knowledge of what happens on the map",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2021, an AI agent competed in a PlayStation Gran Turismo competition, winning against four of the world's best Gran Turismo drivers using deep reinforcement learning",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2024, Google DeepMind introduced SIMA, a type of AI capable of autonomously playing nine previously unseen open-world video games by observing screen output, as well as executing short, specific tasks in response to natural language instructions.


=== Mathematics ===
In mathematics, special forms of formal step-by-step reasoning are used",Artificial Intelligence
"In contrast, LLMs such as GPT-4 Turbo, Gemini Ultra, Claude Opus, LLaMa-2 or Mistral Large are working with probabilistic models, which can produce wrong answers in the form of hallucinations",Artificial Intelligence
"Therefore, they need not only a large database of mathematical problems to learn from but also methods such as supervised fine-tuning or trained classifiers with human-annotated data to improve answers for new problems and learn from corrections",Artificial Intelligence
"A 2024 study showed that the performance of some language models for reasoning capabilities in solving math problems not included in their training data was low, even for problems with only minor deviations from trained data.
Alternatively, dedicated models for mathematic problem solving with higher precision for the outcome including proof of theorems have been developed such as Alpha Tensor, Alpha Geometry and Alpha Proof all from Google DeepMind, Llemma from eleuther or Julius.
When natural language is used to describe mathematical problems, converters transform such prompts into a formal language such as Lean to define mathematic tasks.
Some models have been developed to solve challenging problems and reach good results in benchmark tests, others to serve as educational tools in mathematics.


=== Finance ===
Finance is one of the fastest growing sectors where applied AI tools are being deployed: from retail online banking to investment advice and insurance, where automated ""robot advisers"" have been in use for some years.
World Pensions experts like Nicolas Firzli insist it may be too early to see the emergence of highly innovative AI-informed financial products and services: ""the deployment of AI tools will simply further automatise things: destroying tens of thousands of jobs in banking, financial planning, and pension advice in the process, but I'm not sure it will unleash a new wave of [e.g., sophisticated] pension innovation.""


=== Military ===

Various countries are deploying AI military applications",Artificial Intelligence
"The main applications enhance command and control, communications, sensors, integration and interoperability",Artificial Intelligence
"Research is targeting intelligence collection and analysis, logistics, cyber operations, information operations, and semiautonomous and autonomous vehicles",Artificial Intelligence
"AI technologies enable coordination of sensors and effectors, threat detection and identification, marking of enemy positions, target acquisition, coordination and deconfliction of distributed Joint Fires between networked combat vehicles involving manned and unmanned teams",Artificial Intelligence
"AI was incorporated into military operations in Iraq and Syria.
In November 2023, US Vice President Kamala Harris disclosed a declaration signed by 31 nations to set guardrails for the military use of AI",Artificial Intelligence
"The commitments include using legal reviews to ensure the compliance of military AI with international laws, and being cautious and transparent in the development of this technology.


=== Generative AI ===

In the early 2020s, generative AI gained widespread prominence",Artificial Intelligence
"GenAI is AI capable of generating text, images, videos, or other data using generative models, often in response to prompts.
In March 2023, 58% of U.S",Artificial Intelligence
adults had heard about ChatGPT and 14% had tried it,Artificial Intelligence
"The increasing realism and ease-of-use of AI-based text-to-image generators such as Midjourney, DALL-E, and Stable Diffusion sparked a trend of viral AI-generated photos",Artificial Intelligence
"Widespread attention was gained by a fake photo of Pope Francis wearing a white puffer coat, the fictional arrest of Donald Trump, and a hoax of an attack on the Pentagon, as well as the usage in professional creative arts.


=== Agents ===
Artificial intelligent (AI) agents are software entities designed to perceive their environment, make decisions, and take actions autonomously to achieve specific goals",Artificial Intelligence
"These agents can interact with users, their environment, or other agents",Artificial Intelligence
"AI agents are used in various applications, including virtual assistants, chatbots, autonomous vehicles, game-playing systems, and industrial robotics",Artificial Intelligence
"AI agents operate within the constraints of their programming, available computational resources, and hardware limitations",Artificial Intelligence
This means they are restricted to performing tasks within their defined scope and have finite memory and processing capabilities,Artificial Intelligence
"In real-world applications, AI agents often face time constraints for decision-making and action execution",Artificial Intelligence
"Many AI agents incorporate learning algorithms, enabling them to improve their performance over time through experience or training",Artificial Intelligence
"Using machine learning, AI agents can adapt to new situations and optimise their behaviour for their designated tasks.


=== Other industry-specific tasks ===
There are also thousands of successful AI applications used to solve specific problems for specific industries or institutions",Artificial Intelligence
"In a 2017 survey, one in five companies reported having incorporated ""AI"" in some offerings or processes",Artificial Intelligence
"A few examples are energy storage, medical diagnosis, military logistics, applications that predict the result of judicial decisions, foreign policy, or supply chain management.
AI applications for evacuation and disaster management are growing",Artificial Intelligence
"AI has been used to investigate if and how people evacuated in large scale and small scale evacuations using historical data from GPS, videos or social media",Artificial Intelligence
"Further, AI can provide real time information on the real time evacuation conditions.
In agriculture, AI has helped farmers identify areas that need irrigation, fertilization, pesticide treatments or increasing yield",Artificial Intelligence
"AI has been used to predict the ripening time for crops such as tomatoes, monitor soil moisture, operate agricultural robots, conduct predictive analytics, classify livestock pig call emotions, automate greenhouses, detect diseases and pests, and save water.
Artificial intelligence is used in astronomy to analyze increasing amounts of available data and applications, mainly for ""classification, regression, clustering, forecasting, generation, discovery, and the development of new scientific insights"" for example for discovering exoplanets, forecasting solar activity, and distinguishing between signals and instrumental effects in gravitational wave astronomy",Artificial Intelligence
"It could also be used for activities in space such as space exploration, including analysis of data from space missions, real-time science decisions of spacecraft, space debris avoidance, and more autonomous operation.


== Ethics ==

AI has potential benefits and potential risks",Artificial Intelligence
"AI may be able to advance science and find solutions for serious problems: Demis Hassabis of Deep Mind hopes to ""solve intelligence, and then use that to solve everything else""",Artificial Intelligence
"However, as the use of AI has become widespread, several unintended consequences and risks have been identified",Artificial Intelligence
"In-production systems can sometimes not factor ethics and bias into their AI training processes, especially when the AI algorithms are inherently unexplainable in deep learning.


=== Risks and harm ===


==== Privacy and copyright ====

Machine learning algorithms require large amounts of data",Artificial Intelligence
"The techniques used to acquire this data have raised concerns about privacy, surveillance and copyright.
AI-powered devices and services, such as virtual assistants and IoT products, continuously collect personal information, raising concerns about intrusive data gathering and unauthorized access by third parties",Artificial Intelligence
"The loss of privacy is further exacerbated by AI's ability to process and combine vast amounts of data, potentially leading to a surveillance society where individual activities are constantly monitored and analyzed without adequate safeguards or transparency.
Sensitive user data collected may include online activity records, geolocation data, video or audio",Artificial Intelligence
"For example, in order to build speech recognition algorithms, Amazon has recorded millions of private conversations and allowed temporary workers to listen to and transcribe some of them",Artificial Intelligence
"Opinions about this widespread surveillance range from those who see it as a necessary evil to those for whom it is clearly unethical and a violation of the right to privacy.
AI developers argue that this is the only way to deliver valuable applications",Artificial Intelligence
"and have developed several techniques that attempt to preserve privacy while still obtaining the data, such as data aggregation, de-identification and differential privacy",Artificial Intelligence
"Since 2016, some privacy experts, such as Cynthia Dwork, have begun to view privacy in terms of fairness",Artificial Intelligence
"Brian Christian wrote that experts have pivoted ""from the question of 'what they know' to the question of 'what they're doing with it'.""
Generative AI is often trained on unlicensed copyrighted works, including in domains such as images or computer code; the output is then used under the rationale of ""fair use""",Artificial Intelligence
"Experts disagree about how well and under what circumstances this rationale will hold up in courts of law; relevant factors may include ""the purpose and character of the use of the copyrighted work"" and ""the effect upon the potential market for the copyrighted work""",Artificial Intelligence
"Website owners who do not wish to have their content scraped can indicate it in a ""robots.txt"" file",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2023, leading authors (including John Grisham and Jonathan Franzen) sued AI companies for using their work to train generative AI",Artificial Intelligence
"Another discussed approach is to envision a separate sui generis system of protection for creations generated by AI to ensure fair attribution and compensation for human authors.


==== Dominance by tech giants ====
The commercial AI scene is dominated by Big Tech companies such as Alphabet Inc., Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta Platforms, and Microsoft",Artificial Intelligence
"Some of these players already own the vast majority of existing cloud infrastructure and computing power from data centers, allowing them to entrench further in the marketplace.


==== Substantial power needs and other environmental impacts ====

In January 2024, the International Energy Agency (IEA) released Electricity 2024, Analysis and Forecast to 2026, forecasting electric power use",Artificial Intelligence
This is the first IEA report to make projections for data centers and power consumption for artificial intelligence and cryptocurrency,Artificial Intelligence
"The report states that power demand for these uses might double by 2026, with additional electric power usage equal to electricity used by the whole Japanese nation.
Prodigious power consumption by AI is responsible for the growth of fossil fuels use, and might delay closings of obsolete, carbon-emitting coal energy facilities",Artificial Intelligence
"There is a feverish rise in the construction of data centers throughout the US, making large technology firms (e.g., Microsoft, Meta, Google, Amazon) into voracious consumers of electric power",Artificial Intelligence
Projected electric consumption is so immense that there is concern that it will be fulfilled no matter the source,Artificial Intelligence
A ChatGPT search involves the use of 10 times the electrical energy as a Google search,Artificial Intelligence
The large firms are in haste to find power sources – from nuclear energy to geothermal to fusion,Artificial Intelligence
"The tech firms argue that – in the long view – AI will be eventually kinder to the environment, but they need the energy now",Artificial Intelligence
"AI makes the power grid more efficient and ""intelligent"", will assist in the growth of nuclear power, and track overall carbon emissions, according to technology firms.
A 2024 Goldman Sachs Research Paper, AI Data Centers and the Coming US Power Demand Surge, found ""US power demand (is) likely to experience growth not seen in a generation...."" and forecasts that, by 2030, US data centers will consume 8% of US power, as opposed to 3% in 2022, presaging growth for the electrical power generation industry by a variety of means.Data centers' need for more and more electrical power is such that they might max out the electrical grid",Artificial Intelligence
"The Big Tech companies counter that AI can be used to maximize the utilization of the grid by all.
In 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that big AI companies have begun negotiations with the US nuclear power providers to provide electricity to the data centers",Artificial Intelligence
"In March 2024 Amazon purchased a Pennsylvania nuclear-powered data center for $650 Million (US).
In September 2024, Microsoft announced an agreement with Constellation Energy to re-open the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant to provide Microsoft with 100% of all electric power produced by the plant for 20 years",Artificial Intelligence
"Reopening the plant, which suffered a partial nuclear meltdown of its Unit 2 reactor in 1979, will require Constellation to get through strict regulatory processes which will include extensive safety scrutiny from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission",Artificial Intelligence
"If approved (this will be the first ever US re-commissioning of a nuclear plant), over 835 megahertz of power – enough for 800,000 homes – of energy will be produced",Artificial Intelligence
The cost for re-opening and upgrading is estimated at $1.6 billion (US) and is dependent on tax breaks for nuclear power contained in the 2022 US Inflation Reduction Act,Artificial Intelligence
The US government and the state of Michigan are investing almost $2 billion (US) to reopen the Palisades Nuclear reactor on Lake Michigan,Artificial Intelligence
"Closed since 2022, the plant is planned to be reopened in October 2025",Artificial Intelligence
"The Three Mile Island facility will be renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center after Chris Crane, a nuclear proponent and former CEO of Exelon who was responsible for Exelon spinoff of Constellation.


==== Misinformation ====

YouTube, Facebook and others use recommender systems to guide users to more content",Artificial Intelligence
"These AI programs were given the goal of maximizing user engagement (that is, the only goal was to keep people watching)",Artificial Intelligence
"The AI learned that users tended to choose misinformation, conspiracy theories, and extreme partisan content, and, to keep them watching, the AI recommended more of it",Artificial Intelligence
"Users also tended to watch more content on the same subject, so the AI led people into filter bubbles where they received multiple versions of the same misinformation",Artificial Intelligence
"This convinced many users that the misinformation was true, and ultimately undermined trust in institutions, the media and the government",Artificial Intelligence
"The AI program had correctly learned to maximize its goal, but the result was harmful to society",Artificial Intelligence
"election in 2016, major technology companies took steps to mitigate the problem .
In 2022, generative AI began to create images, audio, video and text that are indistinguishable from real photographs, recordings, films, or human writing",Artificial Intelligence
It is possible for bad actors to use this technology to create massive amounts of misinformation or propaganda,Artificial Intelligence
"AI pioneer Geoffrey Hinton expressed concern about AI enabling ""authoritarian leaders to manipulate their electorates"" on a large scale, among other risks.


==== Algorithmic bias and fairness ====

Machine learning applications will be biased if they learn from biased data",Artificial Intelligence
The developers may not be aware that the bias exists,Artificial Intelligence
Bias can be introduced by the way training data is selected and by the way a model is deployed,Artificial Intelligence
"If a biased algorithm is used to make decisions that can seriously harm people (as it can in medicine, finance, recruitment, housing or policing) then the algorithm may cause discrimination",Artificial Intelligence
"The field of fairness studies how to prevent harms from algorithmic biases.
On June 28, 2015, Google Photos's new image labeling feature mistakenly identified Jacky Alcine and a friend as ""gorillas"" because they were black",Artificial Intelligence
"The system was trained on a dataset that contained very few images of black people, a problem called ""sample size disparity""",Artificial Intelligence
"Google ""fixed"" this problem by preventing the system from labelling anything as a ""gorilla""",Artificial Intelligence
"Eight years later, in 2023, Google Photos still could not identify a gorilla, and neither could similar products from Apple, Facebook, Microsoft and Amazon.
COMPAS is a commercial program widely used by U.S",Artificial Intelligence
courts to assess the likelihood of a defendant becoming a recidivist,Artificial Intelligence
"In 2016, Julia Angwin at ProPublica discovered that COMPAS exhibited racial bias, despite the fact that the program was not told the races of the defendants",Artificial Intelligence
"Although the error rate for both whites and blacks was calibrated equal at exactly 61%, the errors for each race were different—the system consistently overestimated the chance that a black person would re-offend and would underestimate the chance that a white person would not re-offend",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2017, several researchers showed that it was mathematically impossible for COMPAS to accommodate all possible measures of fairness when the base rates of re-offense were different for whites and blacks in the data.
A program can make biased decisions even if the data does not explicitly mention a problematic feature (such as ""race"" or ""gender"")",Artificial Intelligence
"The feature will correlate with other features (like ""address"", ""shopping history"" or ""first name""), and the program will make the same decisions based on these features as it would on ""race"" or ""gender""",Artificial Intelligence
"Moritz Hardt said ""the most robust fact in this research area is that fairness through blindness doesn't work.""
Criticism of COMPAS highlighted that machine learning models are designed to make ""predictions"" that are only valid if we assume that the future will resemble the past",Artificial Intelligence
"If they are trained on data that includes the results of racist decisions in the past, machine learning models must predict that racist decisions will be made in the future",Artificial Intelligence
"If an application then uses these predictions as recommendations, some of these ""recommendations"" will likely be racist",Artificial Intelligence
"Thus, machine learning is not well suited to help make decisions in areas where there is hope that the future will be better than the past",Artificial Intelligence
"It is descriptive rather than prescriptive.
Bias and unfairness may go undetected because the developers are overwhelmingly white and male: among AI engineers, about 4% are black and 20% are women.
There are various conflicting definitions and mathematical models of fairness",Artificial Intelligence
"These notions depend on ethical assumptions, and are influenced by beliefs about society",Artificial Intelligence
"One broad category is distributive fairness, which focuses on the outcomes, often identifying groups and seeking to compensate for statistical disparities",Artificial Intelligence
Representational fairness tries to ensure that AI systems do not reinforce negative stereotypes or render certain groups invisible,Artificial Intelligence
Procedural fairness focuses on the decision process rather than the outcome,Artificial Intelligence
"The most relevant notions of fairness may depend on the context, notably the type of AI application and the stakeholders",Artificial Intelligence
The subjectivity in the notions of bias and fairness makes it difficult for companies to operationalize them,Artificial Intelligence
"Having access to sensitive attributes such as race or gender is also considered by many AI ethicists to be necessary in order to compensate for biases, but it may conflict with anti-discrimination laws.
At its 2022 Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT 2022), the Association for Computing Machinery, in Seoul, South Korea, presented and published findings that recommend that until AI and robotics systems are demonstrated to be free of bias mistakes, they are unsafe, and the use of self-learning neural networks trained on vast, unregulated sources of flawed internet data should be curtailed.


==== Lack of transparency ====

Many AI systems are so complex that their designers cannot explain how they reach their decisions",Artificial Intelligence
"Particularly with deep neural networks, in which there are a large amount of non-linear relationships between inputs and outputs",Artificial Intelligence
"But some popular explainability techniques exist.
It is impossible to be certain that a program is operating correctly if no one knows how exactly it works",Artificial Intelligence
"There have been many cases where a machine learning program passed rigorous tests, but nevertheless learned something different than what the programmers intended",Artificial Intelligence
"For example, a system that could identify skin diseases better than medical professionals was found to actually have a strong tendency to classify images with a ruler as ""cancerous"", because pictures of malignancies typically include a ruler to show the scale",Artificial Intelligence
"Another machine learning system designed to help effectively allocate medical resources was found to classify patients with asthma as being at ""low risk"" of dying from pneumonia",Artificial Intelligence
"Having asthma is actually a severe risk factor, but since the patients having asthma would usually get much more medical care, they were relatively unlikely to die according to the training data",Artificial Intelligence
"The correlation between asthma and low risk of dying from pneumonia was real, but misleading.
People who have been harmed by an algorithm's decision have a right to an explanation",Artificial Intelligence
"Doctors, for example, are expected to clearly and completely explain to their colleagues the reasoning behind any decision they make",Artificial Intelligence
Early drafts of the European Union's General Data Protection Regulation in 2016 included an explicit statement that this right exists,Artificial Intelligence
Industry experts noted that this is an unsolved problem with no solution in sight,Artificial Intelligence
"Regulators argued that nevertheless the harm is real: if the problem has no solution, the tools should not be used.
DARPA established the XAI (""Explainable Artificial Intelligence"") program in 2014 to try to solve these problems.
Several approaches aim to address the transparency problem",Artificial Intelligence
SHAP enables to visualise the contribution of each feature to the output,Artificial Intelligence
"LIME can locally approximate a model's outputs with a simpler, interpretable model",Artificial Intelligence
Multitask learning provides a large number of outputs in addition to the target classification,Artificial Intelligence
These other outputs can help developers deduce what the network has learned,Artificial Intelligence
"Deconvolution, DeepDream and other generative methods can allow developers to see what different layers of a deep network for computer vision have learned, and produce output that can suggest what the network is learning",Artificial Intelligence
"For generative pre-trained transformers, Anthropic developed a technique based on dictionary learning that associates patterns of neuron activations with human-understandable concepts.


==== Bad actors and weaponized AI ====

Artificial intelligence provides a number of tools that are useful to bad actors, such as authoritarian governments, terrorists, criminals or rogue states.
A lethal autonomous weapon is a machine that locates, selects and engages human targets without human supervision",Artificial Intelligence
"Widely available AI tools can be used by bad actors to develop inexpensive autonomous weapons and, if produced at scale, they are potentially weapons of mass destruction",Artificial Intelligence
"Even when used in conventional warfare, it is unlikely that they will be unable to reliably choose targets and could potentially kill an innocent person",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2014, 30 nations (including China) supported a ban on autonomous weapons under the United Nations' Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, however the United States and others disagreed",Artificial Intelligence
"By 2015, over fifty countries were reported to be researching battlefield robots.
AI tools make it easier for authoritarian governments to efficiently control their citizens in several ways",Artificial Intelligence
"Machine learning, operating this data, can classify potential enemies of the state and prevent them from hiding",Artificial Intelligence
Recommendation systems can precisely target propaganda and misinformation for maximum effect,Artificial Intelligence
Advanced AI can make authoritarian centralized decision making more competitive than liberal and decentralized systems such as markets,Artificial Intelligence
It lowers the cost and difficulty of digital warfare and advanced spyware,Artificial Intelligence
"All these technologies have been available since 2020 or earlier—AI facial recognition systems are already being used for mass surveillance in China.
There many other ways that AI is expected to help bad actors, some of which can not be foreseen",Artificial Intelligence
"For example, machine-learning AI is able to design tens of thousands of toxic molecules in a matter of hours.


==== Technological unemployment ====

Economists have frequently highlighted the risks of redundancies from AI, and speculated about unemployment if there is no adequate social policy for full employment.
In the past, technology has tended to increase rather than reduce total employment, but economists acknowledge that ""we're in uncharted territory"" with AI",Artificial Intelligence
"A survey of economists showed disagreement about whether the increasing use of robots and AI will cause a substantial increase in long-term unemployment, but they generally agree that it could be a net benefit if productivity gains are redistributed",Artificial Intelligence
"Risk estimates vary; for example, in the 2010s, Michael Osborne and Carl Benedikt Frey estimated 47% of U.S",Artificial Intelligence
"jobs are at ""high risk"" of potential automation, while an OECD report classified only 9% of U.S",Artificial Intelligence
"The methodology of speculating about future employment levels has been criticised as lacking evidential foundation, and for implying that technology, rather than social policy, creates unemployment, as opposed to redundancies",Artificial Intelligence
"In April 2023, it was reported that 70% of the jobs for Chinese video game illustrators had been eliminated by generative artificial intelligence.
Unlike previous waves of automation, many middle-class jobs may be eliminated by artificial intelligence; The Economist stated in 2015 that ""the worry that AI could do to white-collar jobs what steam power did to blue-collar ones during the Industrial Revolution"" is ""worth taking seriously""",Artificial Intelligence
"Jobs at extreme risk range from paralegals to fast food cooks, while job demand is likely to increase for care-related professions ranging from personal healthcare to the clergy.
From the early days of the development of artificial intelligence, there have been arguments, for example, those put forward by Joseph Weizenbaum, about whether tasks that can be done by computers actually should be done by them, given the difference between computers and humans, and between quantitative calculation and qualitative, value-based judgement.


==== Existential risk ====

It has been argued AI will become so powerful that humanity may irreversibly lose control of it",Artificial Intelligence
"This could, as physicist Stephen Hawking stated, ""spell the end of the human race""",Artificial Intelligence
"This scenario has been common in science fiction, when a computer or robot suddenly develops a human-like ""self-awareness"" (or ""sentience"" or ""consciousness"") and becomes a malevolent character",Artificial Intelligence
"These sci-fi scenarios are misleading in several ways.
First, AI does not require human-like ""sentience"" to be an existential risk",Artificial Intelligence
Modern AI programs are given specific goals and use learning and intelligence to achieve them,Artificial Intelligence
"Philosopher Nick Bostrom argued that if one gives almost any goal to a sufficiently powerful AI, it may choose to destroy humanity to achieve it (he used the example of a paperclip factory manager)",Artificial Intelligence
"Stuart Russell gives the example of household robot that tries to find a way to kill its owner to prevent it from being unplugged, reasoning that ""you can't fetch the coffee if you're dead."" In order to be safe for humanity, a superintelligence would have to be genuinely aligned with humanity's morality and values so that it is ""fundamentally on our side"".
Second, Yuval Noah Harari argues that AI does not require a robot body or physical control to pose an existential risk",Artificial Intelligence
"Things like ideologies, law, government, money and the economy are made of language; they exist because there are stories that billions of people believe",Artificial Intelligence
"The current prevalence of misinformation suggests that an AI could use language to convince people to believe anything, even to take actions that are destructive.
The opinions amongst experts and industry insiders are mixed, with sizable fractions both concerned and unconcerned by risk from eventual superintelligent AI",Artificial Intelligence
"Personalities such as Stephen Hawking, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk, as well as AI pioneers such as Yoshua Bengio, Stuart Russell, Demis Hassabis, and Sam Altman, have expressed concerns about existential risk from AI.
In May 2023, Geoffrey Hinton announced his resignation from Google in order to be able to ""freely speak out about the risks of AI"" without ""considering how this impacts Google."" He notably mentioned risks of an AI takeover, and stressed that in order to avoid the worst outcomes, establishing safety guidelines will require cooperation among those competing in use of AI.
In 2023, many leading AI experts issued the joint statement that ""Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war"".
Other researchers, however, spoke in favor of a less dystopian view",Artificial Intelligence
"AI pioneer Juergen Schmidhuber did not sign the joint statement, emphasising that in 95% of all cases, AI research is about making ""human lives longer and healthier and easier."" While the tools that are now being used to improve lives can also be used by bad actors, ""they can also be used against the bad actors."" Andrew Ng also argued that ""it's a mistake to fall for the doomsday hype on AI—and that regulators who do will only benefit vested interests."" Yann LeCun ""scoffs at his peers' dystopian scenarios of supercharged misinformation and even, eventually, human extinction."" In the early 2010s, experts argued that the risks are too distant in the future to warrant research or that humans will be valuable from the perspective of a superintelligent machine",Artificial Intelligence
"However, after 2016, the study of current and future risks and possible solutions became a serious area of research.


=== Ethical machines and alignment ===

Friendly AI are machines that have been designed from the beginning to minimize risks and to make choices that benefit humans",Artificial Intelligence
"Eliezer Yudkowsky, who coined the term, argues that developing friendly AI should be a higher research priority: it may require a large investment and it must be completed before AI becomes an existential risk.
Machines with intelligence have the potential to use their intelligence to make ethical decisions",Artificial Intelligence
"The field of machine ethics provides machines with ethical principles and procedures for resolving ethical dilemmas.
The field of machine ethics is also called computational morality,
and was founded at an AAAI symposium in 2005.
Other approaches include Wendell Wallach's ""artificial moral agents"" and Stuart J",Artificial Intelligence
"Russell's three principles for developing provably beneficial machines.


=== Open source ===
Active organizations in the AI open-source community include Hugging Face, Google, EleutherAI and Meta",Artificial Intelligence
"Various AI models, such as Llama 2, Mistral or Stable Diffusion, have been made open-weight, meaning that their architecture and trained parameters (the ""weights"") are publicly available",Artificial Intelligence
"Open-weight models can be freely fine-tuned, which allows companies to specialize them with their own data and for their own use-case",Artificial Intelligence
Open-weight models are useful for research and innovation but can also be misused,Artificial Intelligence
"Since they can be fine-tuned, any built-in security measure, such as objecting to harmful requests, can be trained away until it becomes ineffective",Artificial Intelligence
"Some researchers warn that future AI models may develop dangerous capabilities (such as the potential to drastically facilitate bioterrorism) and that once released on the Internet, they cannot be deleted everywhere if needed",Artificial Intelligence
"They recommend pre-release audits and cost-benefit analyses.


=== Frameworks ===
Artificial Intelligence projects can have their ethical permissibility tested while designing, developing, and implementing an AI system",Artificial Intelligence
"An AI framework such as the Care and Act Framework containing the SUM values—developed by the Alan Turing Institute tests projects in four main areas:

Respect the dignity of individual people
Connect with other people sincerely, openly, and inclusively
Care for the wellbeing of everyone
Protect social values, justice, and the public interest
Other developments in ethical frameworks include those decided upon during the Asilomar Conference, the Montreal Declaration for Responsible AI, and the IEEE's Ethics of Autonomous Systems initiative, among others; however, these principles do not go without their criticisms, especially regards to the people chosen contributes to these frameworks.
Promotion of the wellbeing of the people and communities that these technologies affect requires consideration of the social and ethical implications at all stages of AI system design, development and implementation, and collaboration between job roles such as data scientists, product managers, data engineers, domain experts, and delivery managers.
The UK AI Safety Institute released in 2024 a testing toolset called 'Inspect' for AI safety evaluations available under a MIT open-source licence which is freely available on GitHub and can be improved with third-party packages",Artificial Intelligence
"It can be used to evaluate AI models in a range of areas including core knowledge, ability to reason, and autonomous capabilities.


=== Regulation ===

The regulation of artificial intelligence is the development of public sector policies and laws for promoting and regulating AI; it is therefore related to the broader regulation of algorithms",Artificial Intelligence
The regulatory and policy landscape for AI is an emerging issue in jurisdictions globally,Artificial Intelligence
"According to AI Index at Stanford, the annual number of AI-related laws passed in the 127 survey countries jumped from one passed in 2016 to 37 passed in 2022 alone",Artificial Intelligence
"Between 2016 and 2020, more than 30 countries adopted dedicated strategies for AI",Artificial Intelligence
"Most EU member states had released national AI strategies, as had Canada, China, India, Japan, Mauritius, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, U.S., and Vietnam",Artificial Intelligence
"Others were in the process of elaborating their own AI strategy, including Bangladesh, Malaysia and Tunisia",Artificial Intelligence
"The Global Partnership on Artificial Intelligence was launched in June 2020, stating a need for AI to be developed in accordance with human rights and democratic values, to ensure public confidence and trust in the technology",Artificial Intelligence
"Henry Kissinger, Eric Schmidt, and Daniel Huttenlocher published a joint statement in November 2021 calling for a government commission to regulate AI",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2023, OpenAI leaders published recommendations for the governance of superintelligence, which they believe may happen in less than 10 years",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2023, the United Nations also launched an advisory body to provide recommendations on AI governance; the body comprises technology company executives, governments officials and academics",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2024, the Council of Europe created the first international legally binding treaty on AI, called the ""Framework Convention on Artificial Intelligence and Human Rights, Democracy and the Rule of Law""",Artificial Intelligence
"It was adopted by the European Union, the United States, the United Kingdom, and other signatories.
In a 2022 Ipsos survey, attitudes towards AI varied greatly by country; 78% of Chinese citizens, but only 35% of Americans, agreed that ""products and services using AI have more benefits than drawbacks""",Artificial Intelligence
"A 2023 Reuters/Ipsos poll found that 61% of Americans agree, and 22% disagree, that AI poses risks to humanity",Artificial Intelligence
"In a 2023 Fox News poll, 35% of Americans thought it ""very important"", and an additional 41% thought it ""somewhat important"", for the federal government to regulate AI, versus 13% responding ""not very important"" and 8% responding ""not at all important"".
In November 2023, the first global AI Safety Summit was held in Bletchley Park in the UK to discuss the near and far term risks of AI and the possibility of mandatory and voluntary regulatory frameworks",Artificial Intelligence
"28 countries including the United States, China, and the European Union issued a declaration at the start of the summit, calling for international co-operation to manage the challenges and risks of artificial intelligence",Artificial Intelligence
"In May 2024 at the AI Seoul Summit, 16 global AI tech companies agreed to safety commitments on the development of AI.


== History ==

The study of mechanical or ""formal"" reasoning began with philosophers and mathematicians in antiquity",Artificial Intelligence
"The study of logic led directly to Alan Turing's theory of computation, which suggested that a machine, by shuffling symbols as simple as ""0"" and ""1"", could simulate any conceivable form of mathematical reasoning",Artificial Intelligence
"This, along with concurrent discoveries in cybernetics, information theory and neurobiology, led researchers to consider the possibility of building an ""electronic brain""",Artificial Intelligence
"They developed several areas of research that would become part of AI, such as McCullouch and Pitts design for ""artificial neurons"" in 1943, and Turing's influential 1950 paper 'Computing Machinery and Intelligence', which introduced the Turing test and showed that ""machine intelligence"" was plausible.
The field of AI research was founded at a workshop at Dartmouth College in 1956",Artificial Intelligence
The attendees became the leaders of AI research in the 1960s,Artificial Intelligence
"They and their students produced programs that the press described as ""astonishing"": computers were learning checkers strategies, solving word problems in algebra, proving logical theorems and speaking English",Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence laboratories were set up at a number of British and U.S,Artificial Intelligence
"universities in the latter 1950s and early 1960s.
Researchers in the 1960s and the 1970s were convinced that their methods would eventually succeed in creating a machine with general intelligence and considered this the goal of their field",Artificial Intelligence
"In 1965 Herbert Simon predicted, ""machines will be capable, within twenty years, of doing any work a man can do""",Artificial Intelligence
"In 1967 Marvin Minsky agreed, writing that ""within a generation ..",Artificial Intelligence
"the problem of creating 'artificial intelligence' will substantially be solved""",Artificial Intelligence
and British governments cut off exploratory research in response to the criticism of Sir James Lighthill and ongoing pressure from the U.S,Artificial Intelligence
"Minsky's and Papert's book Perceptrons was understood as proving that artificial neural networks would never be useful for solving real-world tasks, thus discrediting the approach altogether",Artificial Intelligence
"The ""AI winter"", a period when obtaining funding for AI projects was difficult, followed.
In the early 1980s, AI research was revived by the commercial success of expert systems, a form of AI program that simulated the knowledge and analytical skills of human experts",Artificial Intelligence
"By 1985, the market for AI had reached over a billion dollars",Artificial Intelligence
"At the same time, Japan's fifth generation computer project inspired the U.S",Artificial Intelligence
"However, beginning with the collapse of the Lisp Machine market in 1987, AI once again fell into disrepute, and a second, longer-lasting winter began.
Up to this point, most of AI's funding had gone to projects that used high-level symbols to represent mental objects like plans, goals, beliefs, and known facts",Artificial Intelligence
"In the 1980s, some researchers began to doubt that this approach would be able to imitate all the processes of human cognition, especially perception, robotics, learning and pattern recognition, and began to look into ""sub-symbolic"" approaches",Artificial Intelligence
"Rodney Brooks rejected ""representation"" in general and focussed directly on engineering machines that move and survive",Artificial Intelligence
"Judea Pearl, Lofti Zadeh and others developed methods that handled incomplete and uncertain information by making reasonable guesses rather than precise logic",Artificial Intelligence
"But the most important development was the revival of ""connectionism"", including neural network research, by Geoffrey Hinton and others",Artificial Intelligence
"In 1990, Yann LeCun successfully showed that convolutional neural networks can recognize handwritten digits, the first of many successful applications of neural networks.
AI gradually restored its reputation in the late 1990s and early 21st century by exploiting formal mathematical methods and by finding specific solutions to specific problems",Artificial Intelligence
"This ""narrow"" and ""formal"" focus allowed researchers to produce verifiable results and collaborate with other fields (such as statistics, economics and mathematics)",Artificial Intelligence
"By 2000, solutions developed by AI researchers were being widely used, although in the 1990s they were rarely described as ""artificial intelligence"".
However, several academic researchers became concerned that AI was no longer pursuing its original goal of creating versatile, fully intelligent machines",Artificial Intelligence
"Beginning around 2002, they founded the subfield of artificial general intelligence (or ""AGI""), which had several well-funded institutions by the 2010s.
Deep learning began to dominate industry benchmarks in 2012 and was adopted throughout the field.
For many specific tasks, other methods were abandoned.
Deep learning's success was based on both hardware improvements (faster computers, graphics processing units, cloud computing) and access to large amounts of data (including curated datasets, such as ImageNet)",Artificial Intelligence
Deep learning's success led to an enormous increase in interest and funding in AI,Artificial Intelligence
"The amount of machine learning research (measured by total publications) increased by 50% in the years 2015–2019.
In 2016, issues of fairness and the misuse of technology were catapulted into center stage at machine learning conferences, publications vastly increased, funding became available, and many researchers re-focussed their careers on these issues",Artificial Intelligence
"The alignment problem became a serious field of academic study.
In the late teens and early 2020s, AGI companies began to deliver programs that created enormous interest",Artificial Intelligence
"In 2015, AlphaGo, developed by DeepMind, beat the world champion Go player",Artificial Intelligence
The program was taught only the rules of the game and developed strategy by itself,Artificial Intelligence
GPT-3 is a large language model that was released in 2020 by OpenAI and is capable of generating high-quality human-like text,Artificial Intelligence
"These programs, and others, inspired an aggressive AI boom, where large companies began investing billions in AI research",Artificial Intelligence
"According to AI Impacts, about $50 billion annually was invested in ""AI"" around 2022 in the U.S",Artificial Intelligence
"job openings existed in 2022.


== Philosophy ==
Philosophical debates have historically sought to determine the nature of intelligence and how to make intelligent machines",Artificial Intelligence
"Another major focus has been whether machines can be conscious, and the associated ethical implications",Artificial Intelligence
"Many other topics in philosophy can relevant to AI, such as epistemology and free will",Artificial Intelligence
"Rapid advancements have intensified public discussions on the philosophy and ethics of AI.


=== Defining artificial intelligence ===

Alan Turing wrote in 1950 ""I propose to consider the question 'can machines think'?"" He advised changing the question from whether a machine ""thinks"", to ""whether or not it is possible for machinery to show intelligent behaviour""",Artificial Intelligence
"He devised the Turing test, which measures the ability of a machine to simulate human conversation",Artificial Intelligence
"Since we can only observe the behavior of the machine, it does not matter if it is ""actually"" thinking or literally has a ""mind""",Artificial Intelligence
"Turing notes that we can not determine these things about other people but ""it is usual to have a polite convention that everyone thinks.""

Russell and Norvig agree with Turing that intelligence must be defined in terms of external behavior, not internal structure",Artificial Intelligence
"However, they are critical that the test requires the machine to imitate humans",Artificial Intelligence
"""Aeronautical engineering texts,"" they wrote, ""do not define the goal of their field as making 'machines that fly so exactly like pigeons that they can fool other pigeons.'"" AI founder John McCarthy agreed, writing that ""Artificial intelligence is not, by definition, simulation of human intelligence"".
McCarthy defines intelligence as ""the computational part of the ability to achieve goals in the world""",Artificial Intelligence
"Another AI founder, Marvin Minsky similarly describes it as ""the ability to solve hard problems""",Artificial Intelligence
The leading AI textbook defines it as the study of agents that perceive their environment and take actions that maximize their chances of achieving defined goals,Artificial Intelligence
"These definitions view intelligence in terms of well-defined problems with well-defined solutions, where both the difficulty of the problem and the performance of the program are direct measures of the ""intelligence"" of the machine—and no other philosophical discussion is required, or may not even be possible.
Another definition has been adopted by Google, a major practitioner in the field of AI",Artificial Intelligence
"This definition stipulates the ability of systems to synthesize information as the manifestation of intelligence, similar to the way it is defined in biological intelligence.
Some authors have suggested in practice, that the definition of AI is vague and difficult to define, with contention as to whether classical algorithms should be categorised as AI, with many companies during the early 2020s AI boom using the term as a marketing buzzword, often even if they did ""not actually use AI in a material way"".


=== Evaluating approaches to AI ===
No established unifying theory or paradigm has guided AI research for most of its history",Artificial Intelligence
"The unprecedented success of statistical machine learning in the 2010s eclipsed all other approaches (so much so that some sources, especially in the business world, use the term ""artificial intelligence"" to mean ""machine learning with neural networks"")",Artificial Intelligence
"Critics argue that these questions may have to be revisited by future generations of AI researchers.


==== Symbolic AI and its limits ====
Symbolic AI (or ""GOFAI"") simulated the high-level conscious reasoning that people use when they solve puzzles, express legal reasoning and do mathematics",Artificial Intelligence
"They were highly successful at ""intelligent"" tasks such as algebra or IQ tests",Artificial Intelligence
"In the 1960s, Newell and Simon proposed the physical symbol systems hypothesis: ""A physical symbol system has the necessary and sufficient means of general intelligent action.""
However, the symbolic approach failed on many tasks that humans solve easily, such as learning, recognizing an object or commonsense reasoning",Artificial Intelligence
"Moravec's paradox is the discovery that high-level ""intelligent"" tasks were easy for AI, but low level ""instinctive"" tasks were extremely difficult",Artificial Intelligence
"Philosopher Hubert Dreyfus had argued since the 1960s that human expertise depends on unconscious instinct rather than conscious symbol manipulation, and on having a ""feel"" for the situation, rather than explicit symbolic knowledge",Artificial Intelligence
"Although his arguments had been ridiculed and ignored when they were first presented, eventually, AI research came to agree with him.
The issue is not resolved: sub-symbolic reasoning can make many of the same inscrutable mistakes that human intuition does, such as algorithmic bias",Artificial Intelligence
"Critics such as Noam Chomsky argue continuing research into symbolic AI will still be necessary to attain general intelligence, in part because sub-symbolic AI is a move away from explainable AI: it can be difficult or impossible to understand why a modern statistical AI program made a particular decision",Artificial Intelligence
"The emerging field of neuro-symbolic artificial intelligence attempts to bridge the two approaches.


==== Neat vs",Artificial Intelligence
"scruffy ====

""Neats"" hope that intelligent behavior is described using simple, elegant principles (such as logic, optimization, or neural networks)",Artificial Intelligence
"""Scruffies"" expect that it necessarily requires solving a large number of unrelated problems",Artificial Intelligence
"Neats defend their programs with theoretical rigor, scruffies rely mainly on incremental testing to see if they work",Artificial Intelligence
"This issue was actively discussed in the 1970s and 1980s, but eventually was seen as irrelevant",Artificial Intelligence
"hard computing ====

Finding a provably correct or optimal solution is intractable for many important problems",Artificial Intelligence
"Soft computing is a set of techniques, including genetic algorithms, fuzzy logic and neural networks, that are tolerant of imprecision, uncertainty, partial truth and approximation",Artificial Intelligence
"Soft computing was introduced in the late 1980s and most successful AI programs in the 21st century are examples of soft computing with neural networks.


==== Narrow vs",Artificial Intelligence
"general AI ====

AI researchers are divided as to whether to pursue the goals of artificial general intelligence and superintelligence directly or to solve as many specific problems as possible (narrow AI) in hopes these solutions will lead indirectly to the field's long-term goals",Artificial Intelligence
"General intelligence is difficult to define and difficult to measure, and modern AI has had more verifiable successes by focusing on specific problems with specific solutions",Artificial Intelligence
"The experimental sub-field of artificial general intelligence studies this area exclusively.


=== Machine consciousness, sentience, and mind ===

The philosophy of mind does not know whether a machine can have a mind, consciousness and mental states, in the same sense that human beings do",Artificial Intelligence
"This issue considers the internal experiences of the machine, rather than its external behavior",Artificial Intelligence
Mainstream AI research considers this issue irrelevant because it does not affect the goals of the field: to build machines that can solve problems using intelligence,Artificial Intelligence
"Russell and Norvig add that ""[t]he additional project of making a machine conscious in exactly the way humans are is not one that we are equipped to take on."" However, the question has become central to the philosophy of mind",Artificial Intelligence
"It is also typically the central question at issue in artificial intelligence in fiction.


==== Consciousness ====

David Chalmers identified two problems in understanding the mind, which he named the ""hard"" and ""easy"" problems of consciousness",Artificial Intelligence
"The easy problem is understanding how the brain processes signals, makes plans and controls behavior",Artificial Intelligence
"The hard problem is explaining how this feels or why it should feel like anything at all, assuming we are right in thinking that it truly does feel like something (Dennett's consciousness illusionism says this is an illusion)",Artificial Intelligence
"While human information processing is easy to explain, human subjective experience is difficult to explain",Artificial Intelligence
"For example, it is easy to imagine a color-blind person who has learned to identify which objects in their field of view are red, but it is not clear what would be required for the person to know what red looks like.


==== Computationalism and functionalism ====

Computationalism is the position in the philosophy of mind that the human mind is an information processing system and that thinking is a form of computing",Artificial Intelligence
Computationalism argues that the relationship between mind and body is similar or identical to the relationship between software and hardware and thus may be a solution to the mind–body problem,Artificial Intelligence
"This philosophical position was inspired by the work of AI researchers and cognitive scientists in the 1960s and was originally proposed by philosophers Jerry Fodor and Hilary Putnam.
Philosopher John Searle characterized this position as ""strong AI"": ""The appropriately programmed computer with the right inputs and outputs would thereby have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds."" Searle counters this assertion with his Chinese room argument, which attempts to show that, even if a machine perfectly simulates human behavior, there is still no reason to suppose it also has a mind.


==== AI welfare and rights ====
It is difficult or impossible to reliably evaluate whether an advanced AI is sentient (has the ability to feel), and if so, to what degree",Artificial Intelligence
"But if there is a significant chance that a given machine can feel and suffer, then it may be entitled to certain rights or welfare protection measures, similarly to animals",Artificial Intelligence
"Sapience (a set of capacities related to high intelligence, such as discernment or self-awareness) may provide another moral basis for AI rights",Artificial Intelligence
"Robot rights are also sometimes proposed as a practical way to integrate autonomous agents into society.
In 2017, the European Union considered granting ""electronic personhood"" to some of the most capable AI systems",Artificial Intelligence
"Similarly to the legal status of companies, it would have conferred rights but also responsibilities",Artificial Intelligence
"Critics argued in 2018 that granting rights to AI systems would downplay the importance of human rights, and that legislation should focus on user needs rather than speculative futuristic scenarios",Artificial Intelligence
"They also noted that robots lacked the autonomy to take part to society on their own.
Progress in AI increased interest in the topic",Artificial Intelligence
"Proponents of AI welfare and rights often argue that AI sentience, if it emerges, would be particularly easy to deny",Artificial Intelligence
"They warn that this may be a moral blind spot analogous to slavery or factory farming, which could lead to large-scale suffering if sentient AI is created and carelessly exploited.


== Future ==


=== Superintelligence and the singularity ===
A superintelligence is a hypothetical agent that would possess intelligence far surpassing that of the brightest and most gifted human mind.If research into artificial general intelligence produced sufficiently intelligent software, it might be able to reprogram and improve itself",Artificial Intelligence
"The improved software would be even better at improving itself, leading to what I",Artificial Intelligence
"Good called an ""intelligence explosion"" and Vernor Vinge called a ""singularity"".
However, technologies cannot improve exponentially indefinitely, and typically follow an S-shaped curve, slowing when they reach the physical limits of what the technology can do.


=== Transhumanism ===

Robot designer Hans Moravec, cyberneticist Kevin Warwick and inventor Ray Kurzweil have predicted that humans and machines may merge in the future into cyborgs that are more capable and powerful than either",Artificial Intelligence
"This idea, called transhumanism, has roots in the writings of Aldous Huxley and Robert Ettinger.
Edward Fredkin argues that ""artificial intelligence is the next step in evolution"", an idea first proposed by Samuel Butler's ""Darwin among the Machines"" as far back as 1863, and expanded upon by George Dyson in his 1998 book Darwin Among the Machines: The Evolution of Global Intelligence.


== In fiction ==

Thought-capable artificial beings have appeared as storytelling devices since antiquity, and have been a persistent theme in science fiction.
A common trope in these works began with Mary Shelley's Frankenstein, where a human creation becomes a threat to its masters",Artificial Intelligence
"Clarke's and Stanley Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey (both 1968), with HAL 9000, the murderous computer in charge of the Discovery One spaceship, as well as The Terminator (1984) and The Matrix (1999)",Artificial Intelligence
"In contrast, the rare loyal robots such as Gort from The Day the Earth Stood Still (1951) and Bishop from Aliens (1986) are less prominent in popular culture.
Isaac Asimov introduced the Three Laws of Robotics in many stories, most notably with the ""Multivac"" super-intelligent computer",Artificial Intelligence
"Asimov's laws are often brought up during lay discussions of machine ethics; while almost all artificial intelligence researchers are familiar with Asimov's laws through popular culture, they generally consider the laws useless for many reasons, one of which is their ambiguity.
Several works use AI to force us to confront the fundamental question of what makes us human, showing us artificial beings that have the ability to feel, and thus to suffer",Artificial Intelligence
"Artificial Intelligence and Ex Machina, as well as the novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, by Philip K",Artificial Intelligence
"Dick considers the idea that our understanding of human subjectivity is altered by technology created with artificial intelligence.

== History ==

The term machine learning was coined in 1959 by Arthur Samuel, an IBM employee and pioneer in the field of computer gaming and artificial intelligence",Machine Learning
"The synonym self-teaching computers was also used in this time period.
Although the earliest machine learning model was introduced in the 1950s when Arthur Samuel invented a program that calculated the winning chance in checkers for each side, the history of machine learning roots back to decades of human desire and effort to study human cognitive processes",Machine Learning
"In 1949, Canadian psychologist Donald Hebb published the book The Organization of Behavior, in which he introduced a theoretical neural structure formed by certain interactions among nerve cells",Machine Learning
"Hebb's model of neurons interacting with one another set a groundwork for how AIs and machine learning algorithms work under nodes, or artificial neurons used by computers to communicate data",Machine Learning
"Other researchers who have studied human cognitive systems contributed to the modern machine learning technologies as well, including logician Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch, who proposed the early mathematical models of neural networks to come up with algorithms that mirror human thought processes.
By the early 1960s, an experimental ""learning machine"" with punched tape memory, called Cybertron, had been developed by Raytheon Company to analyze sonar signals, electrocardiograms, and speech patterns using rudimentary reinforcement learning",Machine Learning
"It was repetitively ""trained"" by a human operator/teacher to recognize patterns and equipped with a ""goof"" button to cause it to reevaluate incorrect decisions",Machine Learning
"A representative book on research into machine learning during the 1960s was Nilsson's book on Learning Machines, dealing mostly with machine learning for pattern classification",Machine Learning
"Interest related to pattern recognition continued into the 1970s, as described by Duda and Hart in 1973",Machine Learning

This definition of the tasks in which machine learning is concerned offers a fundamentally operational definition rather than defining the field in cognitive terms",Machine Learning
"This follows Alan Turing's proposal in his paper ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"", in which the question ""Can machines think?"" is replaced with the question ""Can machines do what we (as thinking entities) can do?"".
Modern-day machine learning has two objectives",Machine Learning

== Relationships to other fields ==


=== Artificial intelligence ===

As a scientific endeavor, machine learning grew out of the quest for artificial intelligence (AI)",Machine Learning
"In the early days of AI as an academic discipline, some researchers were interested in having machines learn from data",Machine Learning
"They attempted to approach the problem with various symbolic methods, as well as what were then termed ""neural networks""; these were mostly perceptrons and other models that were later found to be reinventions of the generalized linear models of statistics",Machine Learning
"Probabilistic reasoning was also employed, especially in automated medical diagnosis.: 488 
However, an increasing emphasis on the logical, knowledge-based approach caused a rift between AI and machine learning",Machine Learning
"Probabilistic systems were plagued by theoretical and practical problems of data acquisition and representation.: 488  By 1980, expert systems had come to dominate AI, and statistics was out of favor",Machine Learning
"Work on symbolic/knowledge-based learning did continue within AI, leading to inductive logic programming(ILP), but the more statistical line of research was now outside the field of AI proper, in pattern recognition and information retrieval.: 708–710, 755  Neural networks research had been abandoned by AI and computer science around the same time",Machine Learning
"This line, too, was continued outside the AI/CS field, as ""connectionism"", by researchers from other disciplines including John Hopfield, David Rumelhart, and Geoffrey Hinton",Machine Learning
"Their main success came in the mid-1980s with the reinvention of backpropagation.: 25 
Machine learning (ML), reorganized and recognized as its own field, started to flourish in the 1990s",Machine Learning
The field changed its goal from achieving artificial intelligence to tackling solvable problems of a practical nature,Machine Learning
"It shifted focus away from the symbolic approaches it had inherited from AI, and toward methods and models borrowed from statistics, fuzzy logic, and probability theory.


=== Data compression ===


=== Data mining ===
Machine learning and data mining often employ the same methods and overlap significantly, but while machine learning focuses on prediction, based on known properties learned from the training data, data mining focuses on the discovery of (previously) unknown properties in the data (this is the analysis step of knowledge discovery in databases)",Machine Learning
"Data mining uses many machine learning methods, but with different goals; on the other hand, machine learning also employs data mining methods as ""unsupervised learning"" or as a preprocessing step to improve learner accuracy",Machine Learning
"Much of the confusion between these two research communities (which do often have separate conferences and separate journals, ECML PKDD being a major exception) comes from the basic assumptions they work with: in machine learning, performance is usually evaluated with respect to the ability to reproduce known knowledge, while in knowledge discovery and data mining (KDD) the key task is the discovery of previously unknown knowledge",Machine Learning
"Evaluated with respect to known knowledge, an uninformed (unsupervised) method will easily be outperformed by other supervised methods, while in a typical KDD task, supervised methods cannot be used due to the unavailability of training data.
Machine learning also has intimate ties to optimization: Many learning problems are formulated as minimization of some loss function on a training set of examples",Machine Learning
"Loss functions express the discrepancy between the predictions of the model being trained and the actual problem instances (for example, in classification, one wants to assign a label to instances, and models are trained to correctly predict the preassigned labels of a set of examples).


=== Generalization ===
Characterizing the generalization of various learning algorithms is an active topic of current research, especially for deep learning algorithms.


=== Statistics ===
Machine learning and statistics are closely related fields in terms of methods, but distinct in their principal goal: statistics draws population inferences from a sample, while machine learning finds generalizable predictive patterns",Machine Learning
"Jordan, the ideas of machine learning, from methodological principles to theoretical tools, have had a long pre-history in statistics",Machine Learning
"He also suggested the term data science as a placeholder to call the overall field.
Conventional statistical analyses require the a priori selection of a model most suitable for the study data set",Machine Learning
"In addition, only significant or theoretically relevant variables based on previous experience are included for analysis",Machine Learning
"In contrast, machine learning is not built on a pre-structured model; rather, the data shape the model by detecting underlying patterns",Machine Learning
"The more variables (input) used to train the model, the more accurate the ultimate model will be.
Leo Breiman distinguished two statistical modeling paradigms: data model and algorithmic model, wherein ""algorithmic model"" means more or less the machine learning algorithms like Random Forest.
Some statisticians have adopted methods from machine learning, leading to a combined field that they call statistical learning.


=== Statistical physics ===
Analytical and computational techniques derived from deep-rooted physics of disordered systems can be extended to large-scale problems, including machine learning, e.g., to analyze the weight space of deep neural networks",Machine Learning
"Statistical physics is thus finding applications in the area of medical diagnostics.


== Theory ==

A core objective of a learner is to generalize from its experience",Machine Learning
"Generalization in this context is the ability of a learning machine to perform accurately on new, unseen examples/tasks after having experienced a learning data set",Machine Learning
"The training examples come from some generally unknown probability distribution (considered representative of the space of occurrences) and the learner has to build a general model about this space that enables it to produce sufficiently accurate predictions in new cases.
The computational analysis of machine learning algorithms and their performance is a branch of theoretical computer science known as computational learning theory via the Probably Approximately Correct Learning (PAC) model",Machine Learning
"Because training sets are finite and the future is uncertain, learning theory usually does not yield guarantees of the performance of algorithms",Machine Learning
"The bias–variance decomposition is one way to quantify generalization error.
For the best performance in the context of generalization, the complexity of the hypothesis should match the complexity of the function underlying the data",Machine Learning
"If the hypothesis is less complex than the function, then the model has under fitted the data",Machine Learning
"If the complexity of the model is increased in response, then the training error decreases",Machine Learning
"But if the hypothesis is too complex, then the model is subject to overfitting and generalization will be poorer.
In addition to performance bounds, learning theorists study the time complexity and feasibility of learning",Machine Learning
"In computational learning theory, a computation is considered feasible if it can be done in polynomial time",Machine Learning
There are two kinds of time complexity results: Positive results show that a certain class of functions can be learned in polynomial time,Machine Learning
"Negative results show that certain classes cannot be learned in polynomial time.


== Approaches ==

Machine learning approaches are traditionally divided into three broad categories, which correspond to learning paradigms, depending on the nature of the ""signal"" or ""feedback"" available to the learning system:

Supervised learning: The computer is presented with example inputs and their desired outputs, given by a ""teacher"", and the goal is to learn a general rule that maps inputs to outputs.
Unsupervised learning: No labels are given to the learning algorithm, leaving it on its own to find structure in its input",Machine Learning
"Unsupervised learning can be a goal in itself (discovering hidden patterns in data) or a means towards an end (feature learning).
Reinforcement learning: A computer program interacts with a dynamic environment in which it must perform a certain goal (such as driving a vehicle or playing a game against an opponent)",Machine Learning
"As it navigates its problem space, the program is provided feedback that's analogous to rewards, which it tries to maximize.
Although each algorithm has advantages and limitations, no single algorithm works for all problems.


=== Supervised learning ===

Supervised learning algorithms build a mathematical model of a set of data that contains both the inputs and the desired outputs",Machine Learning
"The data, known as training data, consists of a set of training examples",Machine Learning
"Each training example has one or more inputs and the desired output, also known as a supervisory signal",Machine Learning
"In the mathematical model, each training example is represented by an array or vector, sometimes called a feature vector, and the training data is represented by a matrix",Machine Learning
"Through iterative optimization of an objective function, supervised learning algorithms learn a function that can be used to predict the output associated with new inputs",Machine Learning
An optimal function allows the algorithm to correctly determine the output for inputs that were not a part of the training data,Machine Learning
"An algorithm that improves the accuracy of its outputs or predictions over time is said to have learned to perform that task.
Types of supervised-learning algorithms include active learning, classification and regression",Machine Learning
"Classification algorithms are used when the outputs are restricted to a limited set of values, and regression algorithms are used when the outputs may have any numerical value within a range",Machine Learning
"As an example, for a classification algorithm that filters emails, the input would be an incoming email, and the output would be the name of the folder in which to file the email",Machine Learning
"Examples of regression would be predicting the height of a person, or the future temperature",Machine Learning
"
Similarity learning is an area of supervised machine learning closely related to regression and classification, but the goal is to learn from examples using a similarity function that measures how similar or related two objects are",Machine Learning
"It has applications in ranking, recommendation systems, visual identity tracking, face verification, and speaker verification.


=== Unsupervised learning ===

Unsupervised learning algorithms find structures in data that has not been labeled, classified or categorized",Machine Learning
"Instead of responding to feedback, unsupervised learning algorithms identify commonalities in the data and react based on the presence or absence of such commonalities in each new piece of data",Machine Learning
"Central applications of unsupervised machine learning include clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation",Machine Learning
Unsupervised learning algorithms also streamlined the process of identifying large indel based haplotypes of a gene of interest from pan-genome,Machine Learning
" 

Cluster analysis is the assignment of a set of observations into subsets (called clusters) so that observations within the same cluster are similar according to one or more predesignated criteria, while observations drawn from different clusters are dissimilar",Machine Learning
"Different clustering techniques make different assumptions on the structure of the data, often defined by some similarity metric and evaluated, for example, by internal compactness, or the similarity between members of the same cluster, and separation, the difference between clusters",Machine Learning
"Other methods are based on estimated density and graph connectivity.
A special type of unsupervised learning called, self-supervised learning involves training a model by generating the supervisory signal from the data itself.


=== Semi-supervised learning ===

Semi-supervised learning falls between unsupervised learning (without any labeled training data) and supervised learning (with completely labeled training data)",Machine Learning
"Some of the training examples are missing training labels, yet many machine-learning researchers have found that unlabeled data, when used in conjunction with a small amount of labeled data, can produce a considerable improvement in learning accuracy.
In weakly supervised learning, the training labels are noisy, limited, or imprecise; however, these labels are often cheaper to obtain, resulting in larger effective training sets.


=== Reinforcement learning ===

Reinforcement learning is an area of machine learning concerned with how software agents ought to take actions in an environment so as to maximize some notion of cumulative reward",Machine Learning
"Due to its generality, the field is studied in many other disciplines, such as game theory, control theory, operations research, information theory, simulation-based optimization, multi-agent systems, swarm intelligence, statistics and genetic algorithms",Machine Learning
"In reinforcement learning, the environment is typically represented as a Markov decision process (MDP)",Machine Learning
Reinforcement learning algorithms do not assume knowledge of an exact mathematical model of the MDP and are used when exact models are infeasible,Machine Learning
"Reinforcement learning algorithms are used in autonomous vehicles or in learning to play a game against a human opponent.


=== Dimensionality reduction ===
Dimensionality reduction is a process of reducing the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables",Machine Learning
"In other words, it is a process of reducing the dimension of the feature set, also called the ""number of features""",Machine Learning
Most of the dimensionality reduction techniques can be considered as either feature elimination or extraction,Machine Learning
One of the popular methods of dimensionality reduction is principal component analysis (PCA),Machine Learning
"PCA involves changing higher-dimensional data (e.g., 3D) to a smaller space (e.g., 2D).
The manifold hypothesis proposes that high-dimensional data sets lie along low-dimensional manifolds, and many dimensionality reduction techniques make this assumption, leading to the area of manifold learning and manifold regularization.


=== Other types ===
Other approaches have been developed which do not fit neatly into this three-fold categorization, and sometimes more than one is used by the same machine learning system",Machine Learning
"For example, topic modeling, meta-learning.


==== Self-learning ====
Self-learning, as a machine learning paradigm was introduced in 1982 along with a neural network capable of self-learning, named crossbar adaptive array (CAA)",Machine Learning
It is learning with no external rewards and no external teacher advice,Machine Learning
"The CAA self-learning algorithm computes, in a crossbar fashion, both decisions about actions and emotions (feelings) about consequence situations",Machine Learning
"The system is driven by the interaction between cognition and emotion.
The self-learning algorithm updates a memory matrix W =||w(a,s)|| such that in each iteration executes the following machine learning routine: 

in situation s perform action a
receive a consequence situation s'
compute emotion of being in the consequence situation v(s')
update crossbar memory  w'(a,s) = w(a,s) + v(s')
It is a system with only one input, situation, and only one output, action (or behavior) a",Machine Learning
There is neither a separate reinforcement input nor an advice input from the environment,Machine Learning
The backpropagated value (secondary reinforcement) is the emotion toward the consequence situation,Machine Learning
"The CAA exists in two environments, one is the behavioral environment where it behaves, and the other is the genetic environment, wherefrom it initially and only once receives initial emotions about situations to be encountered in the behavioral environment",Machine Learning
"After receiving the genome (species) vector from the genetic environment, the CAA learns a goal-seeking behavior, in an environment that contains both desirable and undesirable situations.


==== Feature learning ====

Several learning algorithms aim at discovering better representations of the inputs provided during training",Machine Learning
"Feature learning algorithms, also called representation learning algorithms, often attempt to preserve the information in their input but also transform it in a way that makes it useful, often as a pre-processing step before performing classification or predictions",Machine Learning
"This technique allows reconstruction of the inputs coming from the unknown data-generating distribution, while not being necessarily faithful to configurations that are implausible under that distribution",Machine Learning
"This replaces manual feature engineering, and allows a machine to both learn the features and use them to perform a specific task.
Feature learning can be either supervised or unsupervised",Machine Learning
"In supervised feature learning, features are learned using labeled input data",Machine Learning
"Examples include artificial neural networks, multilayer perceptrons, and supervised dictionary learning",Machine Learning
"In unsupervised feature learning, features are learned with unlabeled input data",Machine Learning
" Examples include dictionary learning, independent component analysis, autoencoders, matrix factorization and various forms of clustering.
Manifold learning algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is low-dimensional",Machine Learning
"Sparse coding algorithms attempt to do so under the constraint that the learned representation is sparse, meaning that the mathematical model has many zeros",Machine Learning
"Multilinear subspace learning algorithms aim to learn low-dimensional representations directly from tensor representations for multidimensional data, without reshaping them into higher-dimensional vectors",Machine Learning
"Deep learning algorithms discover multiple levels of representation, or a hierarchy of features, with higher-level, more abstract features defined in terms of (or generating) lower-level features",Machine Learning
"It has been argued that an intelligent machine is one that learns a representation that disentangles the underlying factors of variation that explain the observed data.
Feature learning is motivated by the fact that machine learning tasks such as classification often require input that is mathematically and computationally convenient to process",Machine Learning
"However, real-world data such as images, video, and sensory data has not yielded attempts to algorithmically define specific features",Machine Learning
"An alternative is to discover such features or representations through examination, without relying on explicit algorithms.


==== Sparse dictionary learning ====

Sparse dictionary learning is a feature learning method where a training example is represented as a linear combination of basis functions and assumed to be a sparse matrix",Machine Learning
The method is strongly NP-hard and difficult to solve approximately,Machine Learning
A popular heuristic method for sparse dictionary learning is the k-SVD algorithm,Machine Learning
"In classification, the problem is to determine the class to which a previously unseen training example belongs",Machine Learning
"For a dictionary where each class has already been built, a new training example is associated with the class that is best sparsely represented by the corresponding dictionary",Machine Learning
Sparse dictionary learning has also been applied in image de-noising,Machine Learning
"The key idea is that a clean image patch can be sparsely represented by an image dictionary, but the noise cannot.


==== Anomaly detection ====

In data mining, anomaly detection, also known as outlier detection, is the identification of rare items, events or observations which raise suspicions by differing significantly from the majority of the data",Machine Learning
"Typically, the anomalous items represent an issue such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text",Machine Learning
"Anomalies are referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions.
In particular, in the context of abuse and network intrusion detection, the interesting objects are often not rare objects, but unexpected bursts of inactivity",Machine Learning
This pattern does not adhere to the common statistical definition of an outlier as a rare object,Machine Learning
"Many outlier detection methods (in particular, unsupervised algorithms) will fail on such data unless aggregated appropriately",Machine Learning
"Instead, a cluster analysis algorithm may be able to detect the micro-clusters formed by these patterns.
Three broad categories of anomaly detection techniques exist",Machine Learning
"Unsupervised anomaly detection techniques detect anomalies in an unlabeled test data set under the assumption that the majority of the instances in the data set are normal, by looking for instances that seem to fit the least to the remainder of the data set",Machine Learning
"Supervised anomaly detection techniques require a data set that has been labeled as ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" and involves training a classifier (the key difference from many other statistical classification problems is the inherently unbalanced nature of outlier detection)",Machine Learning
"Semi-supervised anomaly detection techniques construct a model representing normal behavior from a given normal training data set and then test the likelihood of a test instance to be generated by the model.


==== Robot learning ====
Robot learning is inspired by a multitude of machine learning methods, starting from supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and finally meta-learning (e.g",Machine Learning
"MAML).


==== Association rules ====

Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering relationships between variables in large databases",Machine Learning
"It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measure of ""interestingness"".
Rule-based machine learning is a general term for any machine learning method that identifies, learns, or evolves ""rules"" to store, manipulate or apply knowledge",Machine Learning
The defining characteristic of a rule-based machine learning algorithm is the identification and utilization of a set of relational rules that collectively represent the knowledge captured by the system,Machine Learning
This is in contrast to other machine learning algorithms that commonly identify a singular model that can be universally applied to any instance in order to make a prediction,Machine Learning
"Rule-based machine learning approaches include learning classifier systems, association rule learning, and artificial immune systems.
Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swami introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets",Machine Learning
"For example, the rule 
  
    
      
        {
        
          o
          n
          i
          o
          n
          s
          ,
          p
          o
          t
          a
          t
          o
          e
          s
        
        }
        ⇒
        {
        
          b
          u
          r
          g
          e
          r
        
        }
      
    
    {\displaystyle \{\mathrm {onions,potatoes} \}\Rightarrow \{\mathrm {burger} \}}
  
 found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat",Machine Learning
Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as promotional pricing or product placements,Machine Learning
"In addition to market basket analysis, association rules are employed today in application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics",Machine Learning
"In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions.
Learning classifier systems (LCS) are a family of rule-based machine learning algorithms that combine a discovery component, typically a genetic algorithm, with a learning component, performing either supervised learning, reinforcement learning, or unsupervised learning",Machine Learning
"They seek to identify a set of context-dependent rules that collectively store and apply knowledge in a piecewise manner in order to make predictions.
Inductive logic programming (ILP) is an approach to rule learning using logic programming as a uniform representation for input examples, background knowledge, and hypotheses",Machine Learning
"Given an encoding of the known background knowledge and a set of examples represented as a logical database of facts, an ILP system will derive a hypothesized logic program that entails all positive and no negative examples",Machine Learning
"Inductive programming is a related field that considers any kind of programming language for representing hypotheses (and not only logic programming), such as functional programs.
Inductive logic programming is particularly useful in bioinformatics and natural language processing",Machine Learning
Gordon Plotkin and Ehud Shapiro laid the initial theoretical foundation for inductive machine learning in a logical setting,Machine Learning
Shapiro built their first implementation (Model Inference System) in 1981: a Prolog program that inductively inferred logic programs from positive and negative examples,Machine Learning
"The term inductive here refers to philosophical induction, suggesting a theory to explain observed facts, rather than mathematical induction, proving a property for all members of a well-ordered set.


== Models ==
A machine learning model is a type of mathematical model that, after being ""trained"" on a given dataset, can be used to make predictions or classifications on new data",Machine Learning
"During training, a learning algorithm iteratively adjusts the model's internal parameters to minimize errors in its predictions",Machine Learning
"By extension, the term ""model"" can refer to several levels of specificity, from a general class of models and their associated learning algorithms to a fully trained model with all its internal parameters tuned.
Various types of models have been used and researched for machine learning systems, picking the best model for a task is called model selection.


=== Artificial neural networks ===

Artificial neural networks (ANNs), or connectionist systems, are computing systems vaguely inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains",Machine Learning
"Such systems ""learn"" to perform tasks by considering examples, generally without being programmed with any task-specific rules.
An ANN is a model based on a collection of connected units or nodes called ""artificial neurons"", which loosely model the neurons in a biological brain",Machine Learning
"Each connection, like the synapses in a biological brain, can transmit information, a ""signal"", from one artificial neuron to another",Machine Learning
An artificial neuron that receives a signal can process it and then signal additional artificial neurons connected to it,Machine Learning
"In common ANN implementations, the signal at a connection between artificial neurons is a real number, and the output of each artificial neuron is computed by some non-linear function of the sum of its inputs",Machine Learning
Artificial neurons and edges typically have a weight that adjusts as learning proceeds,Machine Learning
The weight increases or decreases the strength of the signal at a connection,Machine Learning
Artificial neurons may have a threshold such that the signal is only sent if the aggregate signal crosses that threshold,Machine Learning
Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs,Machine Learning
"Signals travel from the first layer (the input layer) to the last layer (the output layer), possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.
The original goal of the ANN approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would",Machine Learning
"However, over time, attention moved to performing specific tasks, leading to deviations from biology",Machine Learning
"Artificial neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.
Deep learning consists of multiple hidden layers in an artificial neural network",Machine Learning
This approach tries to model the way the human brain processes light and sound into vision and hearing,Machine Learning
"Some successful applications of deep learning are computer vision and speech recognition.


=== Decision trees ===

Decision tree learning uses a decision tree as a predictive model to go from observations about an item (represented in the branches) to conclusions about the item's target value (represented in the leaves)",Machine Learning
"It is one of the predictive modeling approaches used in statistics, data mining, and machine learning",Machine Learning
"Tree models where the target variable can take a discrete set of values are called classification trees; in these tree structures, leaves represent class labels, and branches represent conjunctions of features that lead to those class labels",Machine Learning
Decision trees where the target variable can take continuous values (typically real numbers) are called regression trees,Machine Learning
"In decision analysis, a decision tree can be used to visually and explicitly represent decisions and decision making",Machine Learning
"In data mining, a decision tree describes data, but the resulting classification tree can be an input for decision-making.


=== Support-vector machines ===

Support-vector machines (SVMs), also known as support-vector networks, are a set of related supervised learning methods used for classification and regression",Machine Learning
"Given a set of training examples, each marked as belonging to one of two categories, an SVM training algorithm builds a model that predicts whether a new example falls into one category",Machine Learning
"An SVM training algorithm is a non-probabilistic, binary, linear classifier, although methods such as Platt scaling exist to use SVM in a probabilistic classification setting",Machine Learning
"In addition to performing linear classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classification using what is called the kernel trick, implicitly mapping their inputs into high-dimensional feature spaces.


=== Regression analysis ===

Regression analysis encompasses a large variety of statistical methods to estimate the relationship between input variables and their associated features",Machine Learning
"Its most common form is linear regression, where a single line is drawn to best fit the given data according to a mathematical criterion such as ordinary least squares",Machine Learning
"The latter is often extended by regularization methods to mitigate overfitting and bias, as in ridge regression",Machine Learning
"When dealing with non-linear problems, go-to models include polynomial regression (for example, used for trendline fitting in Microsoft Excel), logistic regression (often used in statistical classification) or even kernel regression, which introduces non-linearity by taking advantage of the kernel trick to implicitly map input variables to higher-dimensional space.


=== Bayesian networks ===

A Bayesian network, belief network, or directed acyclic graphical model is a probabilistic graphical model that represents a set of random variables and their conditional independence with a directed acyclic graph (DAG)",Machine Learning
"For example, a Bayesian network could represent the probabilistic relationships between diseases and symptoms",Machine Learning
"Given symptoms, the network can be used to compute the probabilities of the presence of various diseases",Machine Learning
"Bayesian networks that model sequences of variables, like speech signals or protein sequences, are called dynamic Bayesian networks",Machine Learning
"Generalizations of Bayesian networks that can represent and solve decision problems under uncertainty are called influence diagrams.


=== Gaussian processes ===

A Gaussian process is a stochastic process in which every finite collection of the random variables in the process has a multivariate normal distribution, and it relies on a pre-defined covariance function, or kernel, that models how pairs of points relate to each other depending on their locations.
Given a set of observed points, or input–output examples, the distribution of the (unobserved) output of a new point as function of its input data can be directly computed by looking like the observed points and the covariances between those points and the new, unobserved point.
Gaussian processes are popular surrogate models in Bayesian optimization used to do hyperparameter optimization.


=== Genetic algorithms ===

A genetic algorithm (GA) is a search algorithm and heuristic technique that mimics the process of natural selection, using methods such as mutation and crossover to generate new genotypes in the hope of finding good solutions to a given problem",Machine Learning
"In machine learning, genetic algorithms were used in the 1980s and 1990s",Machine Learning
"Conversely, machine learning techniques have been used to improve the performance of genetic and evolutionary algorithms.


=== Belief functions ===

The theory of belief functions, also referred to as evidence theory or Dempster–Shafer theory, is a general framework for reasoning with uncertainty, with understood connections to other frameworks such as probability, possibility and  imprecise probability theories",Machine Learning
"These theoretical frameworks can be thought of as a kind of learner and have some analogous properties of how evidence is combined (e.g.,  Dempster's rule of combination), just like how in a pmf-based Bayesian approach would combine probabilities",Machine Learning
"However, there are many caveats to these beliefs functions when compared to Bayesian approaches in order to incorporate ignorance and uncertainty quantification",Machine Learning
"These belief function approaches that are implemented within the machine learning domain typically leverage a fusion approach of various ensemble methods to better handle the learner's decision boundary, low samples, and ambiguous class issues that standard machine learning approach tend to have difficulty resolving",Machine Learning
"However, the computational complexity of these algorithms are dependent on the number of propositions (classes), and can lead to a much higher computation time when compared to other machine learning approaches.


=== Training models ===
Typically, machine learning models require a high quantity of reliable data to perform accurate predictions",Machine Learning
"When training a machine learning model, machine learning engineers need to target and collect a large and representative sample of data",Machine Learning
"Data from the training set can be as varied as a corpus of text, a collection of images, sensor data, and data collected from individual users of a service",Machine Learning
Overfitting is something to watch out for when training a machine learning model,Machine Learning
Trained models derived from biased or non-evaluated data can result in skewed or undesired predictions,Machine Learning
"Biased models may result in detrimental outcomes, thereby furthering the negative impacts on society or objectives",Machine Learning
Algorithmic bias is a potential result of data not being fully prepared for training,Machine Learning
"Machine learning ethics is becoming a field of study and notably, becoming integrated within machine learning engineering teams.


==== Federated learning ====

Federated learning is an adapted form of distributed artificial intelligence to training machine learning models that decentralizes the training process, allowing for users' privacy to be maintained by not needing to send their data to a centralized server",Machine Learning
This also increases efficiency by decentralizing the training process to many devices,Machine Learning
"For example, Gboard uses federated machine learning to train search query prediction models on users' mobile phones without having to send individual searches back to Google.


== Applications ==
There are many applications for machine learning, including:

In 2006, the media-services provider Netflix held the first ""Netflix Prize"" competition to find a program to better predict user preferences and improve the accuracy of its existing Cinematch movie recommendation algorithm by at least 10%",Machine Learning
A joint team made up of researchers from AT&T Labs-Research in collaboration with the teams Big Chaos and Pragmatic Theory built an ensemble model to win the Grand Prize in 2009 for $1 million,Machine Learning
"Shortly after the prize was awarded, Netflix realized that viewers' ratings were not the best indicators of their viewing patterns (""everything is a recommendation"") and they changed their recommendation engine accordingly",Machine Learning
In 2010 The Wall Street Journal wrote about the firm Rebellion Research and their use of machine learning to predict the financial crisis,Machine Learning
"In 2012, co-founder of Sun Microsystems, Vinod Khosla, predicted that 80% of medical doctors jobs would be lost in the next two decades to automated machine learning medical diagnostic software",Machine Learning
"In 2014, it was reported that a machine learning algorithm had been applied in the field of art history to study fine art paintings and that it may have revealed previously unrecognized influences among artists",Machine Learning
In 2019 Springer Nature published the first research book created using machine learning,Machine Learning
"In 2020, machine learning technology was used to help make diagnoses and aid researchers in developing a cure for COVID-19",Machine Learning
Machine learning was recently applied to predict the pro-environmental behavior of travelers,Machine Learning
"Recently, machine learning technology was also applied to optimize smartphone's performance and thermal behavior based on the user's interaction with the phone",Machine Learning
"When applied correctly, machine learning algorithms (MLAs) can utilize a wide range of company characteristics to predict stock returns without overfitting",Machine Learning
"By employing effective feature engineering and combining forecasts, MLAs can generate results that far surpass those obtained from basic linear techniques like OLS.
Recent advancements in machine learning have extended into the field of quantum chemistry, where novel algorithms now enable the prediction of solvent effects on chemical reactions, thereby offering new tools for chemists to tailor experimental conditions for optimal outcomes.
Machine Learning is becoming a useful tool to investigate and predict evacuation decision making in large scale and small scale disasters",Machine Learning
Different solutions have been tested to predict if and when householders decide to evacuate during wildfires and hurricanes,Machine Learning
"Other applications have been focusing on pre evacuation decisions in building fires.


== Limitations ==
Although machine learning has been transformative in some fields, machine-learning programs often fail to deliver expected results",Machine Learning
"Reasons for this are numerous: lack of (suitable) data, lack of access to the data, data bias, privacy problems, badly chosen tasks and algorithms, wrong tools and people, lack of resources, and evaluation problems.
The ""black box theory"" poses another yet significant challenge",Machine Learning
"Black box refers to a situation where the algorithm or the process of producing an output is entirely opaque, meaning that even the coders of the algorithm cannot audit the pattern that the machine extracted out of the data",Machine Learning
"The House of Lords Select Committee, which claimed that such an ""intelligence system"" that could have a ""substantial impact on an individual's life"" would not be considered acceptable unless it provided ""a full and satisfactory explanation for the decisions"" it makes.
In 2018, a self-driving car from Uber failed to detect a pedestrian, who was killed after a collision",Machine Learning
Attempts to use machine learning in healthcare with the IBM Watson system failed to deliver even after years of time and billions of dollars invested,Machine Learning
"Microsoft's Bing Chat chatbot has been reported to produce hostile and offensive response against its users.
Machine learning has been used as a strategy to update the evidence related to a systematic review and increased reviewer burden related to the growth of biomedical literature",Machine Learning
"While it has improved with training sets, it has not yet developed sufficiently to reduce the workload burden without limiting the necessary sensitivity for the findings research themselves.


=== Bias ===

Different machine learning approaches can suffer from different data biases",Machine Learning
A machine learning system trained specifically on current customers may not be able to predict the needs of new customer groups that are not represented in the training data,Machine Learning
"When trained on human-made data, machine learning is likely to pick up the constitutional and unconscious biases already present in society.
Language models learned from data have been shown to contain human-like biases",Machine Learning
"In an experiment carried out by ProPublica, an investigative journalism organization, a machine learning algorithm's insight into the recidivism rates among prisoners falsely flagged ""black defendants high risk twice as often as white defendants."" In 2015, Google Photos would often tag black people as gorillas, and in 2018, this still was not well resolved, but Google reportedly was still using the workaround to remove all gorillas from the training data and thus was not able to recognize real gorillas at all",Machine Learning
Similar issues with recognizing non-white people have been found in many other systems,Machine Learning
"In 2016, Microsoft tested Tay, a chatbot that learned from Twitter, and it quickly picked up racist and sexist language.
Because of such challenges, the effective use of machine learning may take longer to be adopted in other domains",Machine Learning
"Concern for fairness in machine learning, that is, reducing bias in machine learning and propelling its use for human good, is increasingly expressed by artificial intelligence scientists, including Fei-Fei Li, who reminds engineers that ""[t]here's nothing artificial about AI",Machine Learning
"It's inspired by people, it's created by people, and—most importantly—it impacts people",Machine Learning
"It is a powerful tool we are only just beginning to understand, and that is a profound responsibility.""


=== Explainability ===

Explainable AI (XAI), or Interpretable AI, or Explainable Machine Learning (XML), is artificial intelligence (AI) in which humans can understand the decisions or predictions made by the AI",Machine Learning
"It contrasts with the ""black box"" concept in machine learning where even its designers cannot explain why an AI arrived at a specific decision",Machine Learning
"By refining the mental models of users of AI-powered systems and dismantling their misconceptions, XAI promises to help users perform more effectively",Machine Learning
"XAI may be an implementation of the social right to explanation.


=== Overfitting ===

Settling on a bad, overly complex theory gerrymandered to fit all the past training data is known as overfitting",Machine Learning
"Many systems attempt to reduce overfitting by rewarding a theory in accordance with how well it fits the data but penalizing the theory in accordance with how complex the theory is.


=== Other limitations and vulnerabilities ===
Learners can also disappoint by ""learning the wrong lesson""",Machine Learning
A toy example is that an image classifier trained only on pictures of brown horses and black cats might conclude that all brown patches are likely to be horses,Machine Learning
"A real-world example is that, unlike humans, current image classifiers often do not primarily make judgments from the spatial relationship between components of the picture, and they learn relationships between pixels that humans are oblivious to, but that still correlate with images of certain types of real objects",Machine Learning
"Modifying these patterns on a legitimate image can result in ""adversarial"" images that the system misclassifies.
Adversarial vulnerabilities can also result in nonlinear systems, or from non-pattern perturbations",Machine Learning
"For some systems, it is possible to change the output by only changing a single adversarially chosen pixel",Machine Learning
"Machine learning models are often vulnerable to manipulation and/or evasion via adversarial machine learning.
Researchers have demonstrated how backdoors can be placed undetectably into classifying (e.g., for categories ""spam"" and well-visible ""not spam"" of posts) machine learning models that are often developed and/or trained by third parties",Machine Learning
"Parties can change the classification of any input, including in cases for which a type of data/software transparency is provided, possibly including white-box access.


== Model assessments ==
Classification of machine learning models can be validated by accuracy estimation techniques like the holdout method, which splits the data in a training and test set (conventionally 2/3 training set and 1/3 test set designation) and evaluates the performance of the training model on the test set",Machine Learning
"In comparison, the K-fold-cross-validation method randomly partitions the data into K subsets and then K experiments are performed each respectively considering 1 subset for evaluation and the remaining K-1 subsets for training the model",Machine Learning
"In addition to the holdout and cross-validation methods, bootstrap, which samples n instances with replacement from the dataset, can be used to assess model accuracy.
In addition to overall accuracy, investigators frequently report sensitivity and specificity meaning True Positive Rate (TPR) and True Negative Rate (TNR) respectively",Machine Learning
"Similarly, investigators sometimes report the false positive rate (FPR) as well as the false negative rate (FNR)",Machine Learning
"However, these rates are ratios that fail to reveal their numerators and denominators",Machine Learning
The total operating characteristic (TOC) is an effective method to express a model's diagnostic ability,Machine Learning
"TOC shows the numerators and denominators of the previously mentioned rates, thus TOC provides more information than the commonly used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and ROC's associated area under the curve (AUC).


== Ethics ==

Machine learning poses a host of ethical questions",Machine Learning
"Systems that are trained on datasets collected with biases may exhibit these biases upon use (algorithmic bias), thus digitizing cultural prejudices",Machine Learning
"For example, in 1988, the UK's Commission for Racial Equality found that St",Machine Learning
George's Medical School had been using a computer program trained from data of previous admissions staff and that this program had denied nearly 60 candidates who were found to either be women or have non-European sounding names,Machine Learning
Using job hiring data from a firm with racist hiring policies may lead to a machine learning system duplicating the bias by scoring job applicants by similarity to previous successful applicants,Machine Learning
"Another example includes predictive policing company Geolitica's predictive algorithm that resulted in ""disproportionately high levels of over-policing in low-income and minority communities"" after being trained with historical crime data.
While responsible collection of data and documentation of algorithmic rules used by a system is considered a critical part of machine learning, some researchers blame lack of participation and representation of minority population in the field of AI for machine learning's vulnerability to biases",Machine Learning
"In fact, according to research carried out by the Computing Research Association (CRA) in 2021, ""female faculty merely make up 16.1%"" of all faculty members who focus on AI among several universities around the world",Machine Learning
"resident AI PhD graduates,"" 45% identified as white, 22.4% as Asian, 3.2% as Hispanic, and 2.4% as African American, which further demonstrates a lack of diversity in the field of AI.
AI can be well-equipped to make decisions in technical fields, which rely heavily on data and historical information",Machine Learning
"Because human languages contain biases, machines trained on language corpora will necessarily also learn these biases.
Other forms of ethical challenges, not related to personal biases, are seen in health care",Machine Learning
There are concerns among health care professionals that these systems might not be designed in the public's interest but as income-generating machines,Machine Learning
"This is especially true in the United States where there is a long-standing ethical dilemma of improving health care, but also increasing profits",Machine Learning
"For example, the algorithms could be designed to provide patients with unnecessary tests or medication in which the algorithm's proprietary owners hold stakes",Machine Learning
"There is potential for machine learning in health care to provide professionals an additional tool to diagnose, medicate, and plan recovery paths for patients, but this requires these biases to be mitigated.


== Hardware ==
Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks (a particular narrow subdomain of machine learning) that contain many layers of nonlinear hidden units",Machine Learning
"By 2019, graphic processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method of training large-scale commercial cloud AI",Machine Learning
"OpenAI estimated the hardware computing used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017), and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of compute required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.


=== Neuromorphic/Physical Neural Networks ===
A physical neural network or Neuromorphic computer  is a type of artificial neural network in which an electrically adjustable material is used to emulate the function of a neural synapse",Machine Learning
"""Physical"" neural network is used to emphasize the reliance on physical hardware used to emulate neurons as opposed to software-based approaches",Machine Learning
"More generally the term is applicable to other artificial neural networks in which a memristor or other electrically adjustable resistance material is used to emulate a neural synapse.


=== Embedded Machine Learning ===
Embedded Machine Learning is a sub-field of machine learning, where the machine learning model is run on embedded systems with limited computing resources such as wearable computers, edge devices and microcontrollers",Machine Learning
"Running machine learning model in embedded devices removes the need for transferring and storing data on cloud servers for further processing, henceforth, reducing data breaches and privacy leaks happening because of transferring data, and also minimizes theft of intellectual properties, personal data and business secrets",Machine Learning
"Embedded Machine Learning could be applied through several techniques including hardware acceleration, using approximate computing, optimization of machine learning models and many more",Machine Learning
"Pruning, Quantization, Knowledge Distillation, Low-Rank Factorization, Network Architecture Search (NAS) & Parameter Sharing are few of the techniques used for optimization of machine learning models.

International Machine Learning Society
mloss is an academic database of open-source machine learning software.",Machine Learning
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning methods based on neural networks with representation learning,Deep Learning
"The field takes inspiration from biological neuroscience and is centered around stacking artificial neurons into layers and ""training"" them to process data",Deep Learning
"The adjective ""deep"" refers to the use of multiple layers (ranging from three to several hundred or thousands) in the network",Deep Learning
"Methods used can be either supervised, semi-supervised or unsupervised.
Some common deep learning network architectures include fully connected networks, deep belief networks, recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, generative adversarial networks, transformers, and neural radiance fields",Deep Learning
"These architectures have been applied to fields including computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, machine translation, bioinformatics, drug design, medical image analysis, climate science, material inspection and board game programs, where they have produced results comparable to and in some cases surpassing human expert performance.
Early forms of neural networks were inspired by information processing and distributed communication nodes in biological systems, particularly the human brain",Deep Learning
"However, current neural networks do not intend to model the brain function of organisms, and are generally seen as low-quality models for that purpose.


== Overview ==
Most modern deep learning models are based on multi-layered neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and transformers, although they can also include propositional formulas or latent variables organized layer-wise in deep generative models such as the nodes in deep belief networks and deep Boltzmann machines.
Fundamentally, deep learning refers to a class of machine learning algorithms in which a hierarchy of layers is used to transform input data into a slightly more abstract and composite representation",Deep Learning
"For example, in an image recognition model, the raw input may be an image (represented as a tensor of pixels)",Deep Learning
"The first representational layer may attempt to identify basic shapes such as lines and circles, the second layer may compose and encode arrangements of edges, the third layer may encode a nose and eyes, and the fourth layer may recognize that the image contains a face.
Importantly, a deep learning process can learn which features to optimally place at which level on its own",Deep Learning
"Prior to deep learning, machine learning techniques often involved hand-crafted feature engineering to transform the data into a more suitable representation for a classification algorithm to operate on",Deep Learning
"In the deep learning approach, features are not hand-crafted and the model discovers useful feature representations from the data automatically",Deep Learning
"This does not eliminate the need for hand-tuning; for example, varying numbers of layers and layer sizes can provide different degrees of abstraction.
The word ""deep"" in ""deep learning"" refers to the number of layers through which the data is transformed",Deep Learning
"More precisely, deep learning systems have a substantial credit assignment path (CAP) depth",Deep Learning
The CAP is the chain of transformations from input to output,Deep Learning
"For a feedforward neural network, the depth of the CAPs is that of the network and is the number of hidden layers plus one (as the output layer is also parameterized)",Deep Learning
"For recurrent neural networks, in which a signal may propagate through a layer more than once, the CAP depth is potentially unlimited",Deep Learning
"No universally agreed-upon threshold of depth divides shallow learning from deep learning, but most researchers agree that deep learning involves CAP depth higher than two",Deep Learning
CAP of depth two has been shown to be a universal approximator in the sense that it can emulate any function,Deep Learning
"Beyond that, more layers do not add to the function approximator ability of the network",Deep Learning
"Deep models (CAP > two) are able to extract better features than shallow models and hence, extra layers help in learning the features effectively.
Deep learning architectures can be constructed with a greedy layer-by-layer method",Deep Learning
"Deep learning helps to disentangle these abstractions and pick out which features improve performance.
Deep learning algorithms can be applied to unsupervised learning tasks",Deep Learning
This is an important benefit because unlabeled data are more abundant than the labeled data,Deep Learning
"Examples of deep structures that can be trained in an unsupervised manner are deep belief networks.
The term Deep Learning was introduced to the machine learning community by Rina Dechter in 1986, and to artificial neural networks by Igor Aizenberg and colleagues in 2000, in the context of Boolean threshold neurons",Deep Learning
"Although the history of its appearance is apparently more complicated.


== Interpretations ==
Deep neural networks are generally interpreted in terms of the universal approximation theorem or probabilistic inference.
The classic universal approximation theorem concerns the capacity of feedforward neural networks with a single hidden layer of finite size to approximate continuous functions",Deep Learning
"In 1989, the first proof was published by George Cybenko for sigmoid activation functions and was generalised to feed-forward multi-layer architectures in 1991 by Kurt Hornik",Deep Learning
"Recent work also showed that universal approximation also holds for non-bounded activation functions such as Kunihiko Fukushima's rectified linear unit.
The universal approximation theorem for deep neural networks concerns the capacity of networks with bounded width but the depth is allowed to grow",Deep Learning
"proved that if the width of a deep neural network with ReLU activation is strictly larger than the input dimension, then the network can approximate any Lebesgue integrable function; if the width is smaller or equal to the input dimension, then a deep neural network is not a universal approximator.
The probabilistic interpretation derives from the field of machine learning",Deep Learning
"It features inference, as well as the optimization concepts of training and testing, related to fitting and generalization, respectively",Deep Learning
"More specifically, the probabilistic interpretation considers the activation nonlinearity as a cumulative distribution function",Deep Learning
The probabilistic interpretation led to the introduction of dropout as regularizer in neural networks,Deep Learning
"The probabilistic interpretation was introduced by researchers including Hopfield, Widrow and Narendra and popularized in surveys such as the one by Bishop.


== History ==


=== Before 1980 ===
There are two types of artificial neural network (ANN): feedforward neural network (FNN) or multilayer perceptron (MLP) and recurrent neural networks (RNN)",Deep Learning
"In the 1920s, Wilhelm Lenz and Ernst Ising created the Ising model which is essentially a non-learning RNN architecture consisting of neuron-like threshold elements",Deep Learning
His learning RNN was republished by John Hopfield in 1982,Deep Learning
Other early recurrent neural networks were published by Kaoru Nakano in 1971,Deep Learning
"Already in 1948, Alan Turing produced work on ""Intelligent Machinery""  that was not published in his lifetime, containing ""ideas related to artificial evolution and learning RNNs.""
Frank Rosenblatt (1958) proposed the perceptron, an MLP with 3 layers: an input layer, a hidden layer with randomized weights that did not learn, and an output layer",Deep Learning
"He later published a 1962 book that also introduced variants and computer experiments, including a version with four-layer perceptrons ""with adaptive preterminal networks"" where the last two layers have learned weights (here he credits H",Deep Learning
Knight).: section 16  The book cites an earlier network by R,Deep Learning
"Joseph (1960) ""functionally equivalent to a variation of"" this four-layer system (the book mentions Joseph over 30 times)",Deep Learning
"Should Joseph therefore be considered the originator of proper adaptive multilayer perceptrons with learning hidden units? Unfortunately, the learning algorithm was not a functional one, and fell into oblivion.
The first working deep learning algorithm was the Group method of data handling, a method to train arbitrarily deep neural networks, published by Alexey Ivakhnenko and Lapa in 1965",Deep Learning
"They regarded it as a form of polynomial regression, or a generalization of Rosenblatt's perceptron",Deep Learning
"A 1971 paper described a deep network with eight layers trained by this method, which is based on layer by layer training through regression analysis",Deep Learning
Superfluous hidden units are pruned using a separate validation set,Deep Learning
"Since the activation functions of the nodes are Kolmogorov-Gabor polynomials, these were also the first deep networks with multiplicative units or ""gates.""
The first deep learning multilayer perceptron trained by stochastic gradient descent was published in 1967 by Shun'ichi Amari",Deep Learning
"In computer experiments conducted by Amari's student Saito, a five layer MLP with two modifiable layers learned  internal representations to classify non-linearily separable pattern classes",Deep Learning
"Subsequent developments in hardware and hyperparameter tunings have made end-to-end stochastic gradient descent the currently dominant training technique.
In 1969, Kunihiko Fukushima introduced the ReLU (rectified linear unit) activation function",Deep Learning
"The rectifier has become the most popular activation function for deep learning.
Deep learning architectures for convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with convolutional layers and downsampling layers began with the Neocognitron introduced by Kunihiko Fukushima in 1979, though not trained by backpropagation",Deep Learning
"
Backpropagation is an efficient application of the chain rule derived by Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz in 1673 to networks of differentiable nodes",Deep Learning
"The terminology ""back-propagating errors"" was actually introduced in 1962 by Rosenblatt, but he did not know how to implement this, although Henry J",Deep Learning
Kelley had a continuous precursor of backpropagation in 1960 in the context of control theory,Deep Learning
The modern form of backpropagation was first published in Seppo Linnainmaa's master thesis (1970),Deep Learning
"Paul Werbos applied backpropagation to neural networks in 1982 (his 1974 PhD thesis, reprinted in a 1994 book, did not yet describe the algorithm)",Deep Learning
"popularised backpropagation but did not cite the original work.


=== 1980s-2000s ===
The time delay neural network (TDNN) was introduced in 1987 by Alex Waibel to apply CNN to phoneme recognition",Deep Learning
" In 1988, Wei Zhang applied a backpropagation-trained CNN to alphabet recognition",Deep Learning
created a CNN called LeNet for recognizing handwritten ZIP codes on mail,Deep Learning
"In 1990, Wei Zhang implemented a CNN on optical computing hardware",Deep Learning
"In 1991, a CNN was applied to medical image object segmentation and breast cancer detection in mammograms",Deep Learning
"LeNet-5 (1998), a 7-level CNN by Yann LeCun et al., that classifies digits, was applied by several banks to recognize hand-written numbers on checks  digitized in 32x32 pixel images.
Recurrent neural networks (RNN) were further developed in the 1980s",Deep Learning
"Recurrence is used for sequence processing, and when a recurrent network is unrolled, it mathematically resembles a deep feedforward layer",Deep Learning
"Consequently, they have similar properties and issues, and their developments had mutual influences",Deep Learning
"In RNN, two early influential works were the Jordan network (1986) and the Elman network (1990), which applied RNN to study problems in cognitive psychology.
In the 1980s, backpropagation did not work well for deep learning with long credit assignment paths",Deep Learning
"To overcome this problem, in 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber proposed a hierarchy of RNNs pre-trained one level at a time by self-supervised learning where each RNN tries to predict its own next input, which is the next unexpected input of the RNN below",Deep Learning
"This ""neural history compressor"" uses predictive coding  to learn internal representations at multiple self-organizing time scales",Deep Learning
"The RNN hierarchy can be collapsed into a single RNN, by  distilling a higher level chunker network into a lower level automatizer network",Deep Learning
"In 1993, a neural history compressor solved a ""Very Deep Learning"" task that required more than 1000 subsequent layers in an RNN unfolded in time",Deep Learning
"The ""P"" in ChatGPT refers to such pre-training.
Sepp Hochreiter's diploma thesis (1991) implemented the neural history compressor, and identified and analyzed the vanishing gradient problem",Deep Learning
 Hochreiter proposed recurrent residual connections to solve the vanishing gradient problem,Deep Learning
"This led to the long short-term memory (LSTM), published in 1995",Deep Learning
"LSTM can learn ""very deep learning"" tasks with long credit assignment paths that require memories of events that happened thousands of discrete time steps before",Deep Learning
"That LSTM was not yet the modern architecture, which required a ""forget gate"", introduced in 1999, which became the standard RNN architecture.
In 1991, Jürgen Schmidhuber also published adversarial neural networks that contest with each other in the form of a zero-sum game, where one network's gain is the other network's loss",Deep Learning
The first network is a generative model that models a probability distribution over output patterns,Deep Learning
The second network learns by gradient descent to predict the reactions of the environment to these patterns,Deep Learning
"In 2014, this principle was used in generative adversarial networks (GANs).
During 1985–1995, inspired by statistical mechanics, several architectures and methods were developed by Terry Sejnowski, Peter Dayan, Geoffrey Hinton, etc., including the Boltzmann machine, restricted Boltzmann machine, Helmholtz machine, and the wake-sleep algorithm",Deep Learning
These were designed for unsupervised learning of deep generative models,Deep Learning
"Boltzmann machine learning algorithm, published in 1985, was briefly popular before being eclipsed by the backpropagation algorithm in 1986",Deep Learning
"A 1988 network became state of the art in protein structure prediction, an early application of deep learning to bioinformatics.
Both shallow and deep learning (e.g., recurrent nets) of ANNs for speech recognition have been explored for many years",Deep Learning
These methods never outperformed non-uniform internal-handcrafting Gaussian mixture model/Hidden Markov model (GMM-HMM) technology based on generative models of speech trained discriminatively,Deep Learning
"Key difficulties have been analyzed, including gradient diminishing and weak temporal correlation structure in neural predictive models",Deep Learning
"Additional difficulties were the lack of training data and limited computing power.
Most speech recognition researchers moved away from neural nets to pursue generative modeling",Deep Learning
An exception was at SRI International in the late 1990s,Deep Learning
"Funded by the US government's NSA and DARPA, SRI researched in speech and speaker recognition",Deep Learning
The speaker recognition team led by Larry Heck reported significant success with deep neural networks in speech processing in the 1998 NIST Speaker Recognition benchmark,Deep Learning
"It was deployed in the Nuance Verifier, representing the first major industrial application of deep learning.
The principle of elevating ""raw"" features over hand-crafted optimization was first explored successfully in the architecture of deep autoencoder on the ""raw"" spectrogram or linear filter-bank features in the late 1990s, showing its superiority over the Mel-Cepstral features that contain stages of fixed transformation from spectrograms",Deep Learning
"The raw features of speech, waveforms, later produced excellent larger-scale results.


=== 2000s ===
Neural networks entered a null, and simpler models that use task-specific handcrafted features such as Gabor filters and support vector machines (SVMs) became the preferred choices in the 1990s and 2000s, because of artificial neural networks' computational cost and a lack of understanding of how the brain wires its biological networks.
In 2003, LSTM became competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks",Deep Learning
"In 2006, Alex Graves, Santiago Fernández, Faustino Gomez, and Schmidhuber combined it with connectionist temporal classification (CTC) in stacks of LSTMs",Deep Learning
"In 2009, it became the first RNN to win a pattern recognition contest, in connected handwriting recognition.
In 2006, publications by Geoff Hinton, Ruslan Salakhutdinov, Osindero and Teh deep belief networks were developed for generative modeling",Deep Learning
"They are trained by training one restricted Boltzmann machine, then freezing it and training another one on top of the first one, and so on, then optionally fine-tuned using supervised backpropagation",Deep Learning
"They could model high-dimensional probability distributions, such as the distribution of MNIST images, but convergence was slow.
The impact of deep learning in industry began in the early 2000s, when CNNs already processed an estimated 10% to 20% of all the checks written in the US, according to Yann LeCun",Deep Learning
"Industrial applications of deep learning to large-scale speech recognition started around 2010.
The 2009 NIPS Workshop on Deep Learning for Speech Recognition was motivated by the limitations of deep generative models of speech, and the possibility that given more capable hardware and large-scale data sets that deep neural nets might become practical",Deep Learning
It was believed that pre-training DNNs using generative models of deep belief nets (DBN) would overcome the main difficulties of neural nets,Deep Learning
"However, it was discovered that replacing pre-training with large amounts of training data for straightforward backpropagation when using DNNs with large, context-dependent output layers produced error rates dramatically lower than then-state-of-the-art Gaussian mixture model (GMM)/Hidden Markov Model (HMM) and also than more-advanced generative model-based systems",Deep Learning
"The nature of the recognition errors produced by the two types of systems was characteristically different, offering technical insights into how to integrate deep learning into the existing highly efficient, run-time speech decoding system deployed by all major speech recognition systems",Deep Learning
"Analysis around 2009–2010, contrasting the GMM (and other generative speech models) vs",Deep Learning
"DNN models, stimulated early industrial investment in deep learning for speech recognition",Deep Learning
" That analysis was done with comparable performance (less than 1.5% in error rate) between discriminative DNNs and generative models.
In 2010, researchers extended deep learning from TIMIT to large vocabulary speech recognition, by adopting large output layers of the DNN based on context-dependent HMM states constructed by decision trees.


=== Deep learning revolution ===

The deep learning revolution started around CNN- and GPU-based computer vision.
Although CNNs trained by backpropagation had been around for decades and GPU implementations of NNs for years, including CNNs, faster implementations of CNNs on GPUs were needed to progress on computer vision",Deep Learning
"Later, as deep learning becomes widespread, specialized hardware and algorithm optimizations were developed specifically for deep learning.
A key advance for the deep learning revolution was hardware advances, especially GPU",Deep Learning
"In 2009, Raina, Madhavan, and Andrew Ng reported a 100M deep belief network trained on 30 Nvidia GeForce GTX 280 GPUs, an early demonstration of GPU-based deep learning",Deep Learning
"They reported up to 70 times faster training.
In 2011, a CNN named DanNet by Dan Ciresan, Ueli Meier, Jonathan Masci, Luca Maria Gambardella, and Jürgen Schmidhuber achieved for the first time superhuman performance in a visual pattern recognition contest, outperforming traditional methods by a factor of 3",Deep Learning
"They also showed how max-pooling CNNs on GPU improved performance significantly.
In 2012, Andrew Ng and Jeff Dean created an FNN that learned to recognize higher-level concepts, such as cats, only from watching unlabeled images taken from YouTube videos.
In October 2012, AlexNet by Alex Krizhevsky, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey Hinton won the large-scale ImageNet competition by a significant margin over shallow machine learning methods",Deep Learning
"Further incremental improvements included the VGG-16 network by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman and Google's Inceptionv3.
The success in image classification was then extended to the more challenging task of generating descriptions (captions) for images, often as a combination of CNNs and LSTMs.
In 2014, the state of the art was training “very deep neural network” with 20 to 30 layers",Deep Learning
"Stacking too many layers led to a steep reduction in training accuracy, known as the ""degradation"" problem",Deep Learning
"In 2015, two techniques were developed to train very deep networks: the Highway Network was published in May 2015, and the residual neural network (ResNet) in Dec 2015",Deep Learning
"ResNet behaves like an open-gated Highway Net.
Around the same time, deep learning started impacting the field of art",Deep Learning
"Early examples included Google DeepDream (2015), and neural style transfer (2015), both of which were based on pretrained image classification neural networks, such as VGG-19.
Generative adversarial network (GAN) by (Ian Goodfellow et al., 2014) (based on  Jürgen Schmidhuber's principle of artificial curiosity)
became state of the art in generative modeling during 2014-2018 period",Deep Learning
Excellent image quality is achieved by Nvidia's StyleGAN (2018) based on the Progressive GAN by Tero Karras et al,Deep Learning
Here the GAN generator is grown from small to large scale in a pyramidal fashion,Deep Learning
"Image generation by GAN reached popular success, and provoked discussions concerning deepfakes",Deep Learning
" Diffusion models (2015) eclipsed GANs in generative modeling since then, with systems such as DALL·E 2 (2022) and Stable Diffusion (2022).
In 2015, Google's speech recognition improved by 49% by an LSTM-based model, which they made available through Google Voice Search on smartphone.
Deep learning is part of state-of-the-art systems in various disciplines, particularly computer vision and automatic speech recognition (ASR)",Deep Learning
"Results on commonly used evaluation sets such as TIMIT (ASR) and MNIST (image classification), as well as a range of large-vocabulary speech recognition tasks have steadily improved",Deep Learning
"but are more successful in computer vision.
Yoshua Bengio, Geoffrey Hinton and Yann LeCun were awarded the 2018 Turing Award for ""conceptual and engineering breakthroughs that have made deep neural networks a critical component of computing.""


== Neural networks ==

Artificial neural networks (ANNs) or connectionist systems are computing systems inspired by the biological neural networks that constitute animal brains",Deep Learning
"Such systems learn (progressively improve their ability) to do tasks by considering examples, generally without task-specific programming",Deep Learning
"For example, in image recognition, they might learn to identify images that contain cats by analyzing example images that have been manually labeled as ""cat"" or ""no cat"" and using the analytic results to identify cats in other images",Deep Learning
"They have found most use in applications difficult to express with a traditional computer algorithm using rule-based programming.
An ANN is based on a collection of connected units called artificial neurons, (analogous to biological neurons in a biological brain)",Deep Learning
Each connection (synapse) between neurons can transmit a signal to another neuron,Deep Learning
The receiving (postsynaptic) neuron can process the signal(s) and then signal downstream neurons connected to it,Deep Learning
"Neurons may have state, generally represented by real numbers, typically between 0 and 1",Deep Learning
"Neurons and synapses may also have a weight that varies as learning proceeds, which can increase or decrease the strength of the signal that it sends downstream.
Typically, neurons are organized in layers",Deep Learning
Different layers may perform different kinds of transformations on their inputs,Deep Learning
"Signals travel from the first (input), to the last (output) layer, possibly after traversing the layers multiple times.
The original goal of the neural network approach was to solve problems in the same way that a human brain would",Deep Learning
"Over time, attention focused on matching specific mental abilities, leading to deviations from biology such as backpropagation, or passing information in the reverse direction and adjusting the network to reflect that information.
Neural networks have been used on a variety of tasks, including computer vision, speech recognition, machine translation, social network filtering, playing board and video games and medical diagnosis.
As of 2017, neural networks typically have a few thousand to a few million units and millions of connections",Deep Learning
"Despite this number being several order of magnitude less than the number of neurons on a human brain, these networks can perform many tasks at a level beyond that of humans (e.g., recognizing faces, or playing ""Go"").


=== Deep neural networks ===
A deep neural network (DNN) is an artificial neural network with multiple layers between the input and output layers",Deep Learning
"There are different types of neural networks but they always consist of the same components: neurons, synapses, weights, biases, and functions",Deep Learning
"These components as a whole function in a way that mimics functions of the human brain, and can be trained like any other ML algorithm.
For example, a DNN that is trained to recognize dog breeds will go over the given image and calculate the probability that the dog in the image is a certain breed",Deep Learning
"The user can review the results and select which probabilities the network should display (above a certain threshold, etc.) and return the proposed label",Deep Learning
"Each mathematical manipulation as such is considered a layer, and complex DNN have many layers, hence the name ""deep"" networks.
DNNs can model complex non-linear relationships",Deep Learning
DNN architectures generate compositional models where the object is expressed as a layered composition of primitives,Deep Learning
"The extra layers enable composition of features from lower layers, potentially modeling complex data with fewer units than a similarly performing shallow network",Deep Learning
"For instance, it was proved that sparse multivariate polynomials are exponentially easier to approximate with DNNs than with shallow networks.
Deep architectures include many variants of a few basic approaches",Deep Learning
"It is not always possible to compare the performance of multiple architectures, unless they have been evaluated on the same data sets.
DNNs are typically feedforward networks in which data flows from the input layer to the output layer without looping back",Deep Learning
"At first, the DNN creates a map of virtual neurons and assigns random numerical values, or ""weights"", to connections between them",Deep Learning
The weights and inputs are multiplied and return an output between 0 and 1,Deep Learning
"If the network did not accurately recognize a particular pattern, an algorithm would adjust the weights",Deep Learning
"That way the algorithm can make certain parameters more influential, until it determines the correct mathematical manipulation to fully process the data.
Recurrent neural networks, in which data can flow in any direction, are used for applications such as language modeling",Deep Learning
"Long short-term memory is particularly effective for this use.
Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are used in computer vision",Deep Learning
"CNNs also have been applied to acoustic modeling for automatic speech recognition (ASR).


==== Challenges ====
As with ANNs, many issues can arise with naively trained DNNs",Deep Learning
"Two common issues are overfitting and computation time.
DNNs are prone to overfitting because of the added layers of abstraction, which allow them to model rare dependencies in the training data",Deep Learning
"Regularization methods such as Ivakhnenko's unit pruning or weight decay (
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            2
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell _{2}}
  
-regularization) or sparsity (
  
    
      
        
          ℓ
          
            1
          
        
      
    
    {\displaystyle \ell _{1}}
  
-regularization) can be applied during training to combat overfitting",Deep Learning
Alternatively dropout regularization randomly omits units from the hidden layers during training,Deep Learning
"Finally, data can be augmented via methods such as cropping and rotating such that smaller training sets can be increased in size to reduce the chances of overfitting.
DNNs must consider many training parameters, such as the size (number of layers and number of units per layer), the learning rate, and initial weights",Deep Learning
Sweeping through the parameter space for optimal parameters may not be feasible due to the cost in time and computational resources,Deep Learning
"Various tricks, such as batching (computing the gradient on several training examples at once rather than individual examples) speed up computation",Deep Learning
"Large processing capabilities of many-core architectures (such as GPUs or the Intel Xeon Phi) have produced significant speedups in training, because of the suitability of such processing architectures for the matrix and vector computations.
Alternatively, engineers may look for other types of neural networks with more straightforward and convergent training algorithms",Deep Learning
CMAC (cerebellar model articulation controller) is one such kind of neural network,Deep Learning
"The training process can be guaranteed to converge in one step with a new batch of data, and the computational complexity of the training algorithm is linear with respect to the number of neurons involved.


== Hardware ==
Since the 2010s, advances in both machine learning algorithms and computer hardware have led to more efficient methods for training deep neural networks that contain many layers of non-linear hidden units and a very large output layer",Deep Learning
"By 2019, graphics processing units (GPUs), often with AI-specific enhancements, had displaced CPUs as the dominant method for training large-scale commercial cloud AI ",Deep Learning
"OpenAI estimated the hardware computation used in the largest deep learning projects from AlexNet (2012) to AlphaZero (2017) and found a 300,000-fold increase in the amount of computation required, with a doubling-time trendline of 3.4 months.
Special electronic circuits called deep learning processors were designed to speed up deep learning algorithms",Deep Learning
Deep learning processors include neural processing units (NPUs) in Huawei cellphones and cloud computing servers such as tensor processing units (TPU) in the Google Cloud Platform,Deep Learning
"Cerebras Systems has also built a dedicated system to handle large deep learning models, the CS-2, based on the largest processor in the industry, the second-generation Wafer Scale Engine (WSE-2).
Atomically thin semiconductors are considered promising for energy-efficient deep learning hardware where the same basic device structure is used for both logic operations and data storage.
In 2020, Marega et al",Deep Learning
"published experiments with a large-area active channel material for developing logic-in-memory devices and circuits based on floating-gate field-effect transistors (FGFETs).
In 2021, J",Deep Learning
proposed an integrated photonic hardware accelerator for parallel convolutional processing,Deep Learning
"The authors identify two key advantages of integrated photonics over its electronic counterparts: (1) massively parallel data transfer through wavelength division multiplexing in conjunction with frequency combs, and (2) extremely high data modulation speeds",Deep Learning
"Their system can execute trillions of multiply-accumulate operations per second, indicating the potential of integrated photonics in data-heavy AI applications.


== Applications ==


=== Automatic speech recognition ===

Large-scale automatic speech recognition is the first and most convincing successful case of deep learning",Deep Learning
"LSTM RNNs can learn ""Very Deep Learning"" tasks that involve multi-second intervals containing speech events separated by thousands of discrete time steps, where one time step corresponds to about 10 ms",Deep Learning
"LSTM with forget gates is competitive with traditional speech recognizers on certain tasks.
The initial success in speech recognition was based on small-scale recognition tasks based on TIMIT",Deep Learning
"The data set contains 630 speakers from eight major dialects of American English, where each speaker reads 10 sentences",Deep Learning
"More importantly, the TIMIT task concerns phone-sequence recognition, which, unlike word-sequence recognition, allows weak phone bigram language models",Deep Learning
This lets the strength of the acoustic modeling aspects of speech recognition be more easily analyzed,Deep Learning
"The error rates listed below, including these early results and measured as percent phone error rates (PER), have been summarized since 1991.

The debut of DNNs for speaker recognition in the late 1990s and speech recognition around 2009-2011 and of LSTM around 2003–2007, accelerated progress in eight major areas:

Scale-up/out and accelerated DNN training and decoding
Sequence discriminative training
Feature processing by deep models with solid understanding of the underlying mechanisms
Adaptation of DNNs and related deep models
Multi-task and transfer learning by DNNs and related deep models
CNNs and how to design them to best exploit domain knowledge of speech
RNN and its rich LSTM variants
Other types of deep models including tensor-based models and integrated deep generative/discriminative models.
All major commercial speech recognition systems (e.g., Microsoft Cortana, Xbox, Skype Translator, Amazon Alexa, Google Now, Apple Siri, Baidu and iFlyTek voice search, and a range of Nuance speech products, etc.) are based on deep learning.


=== Image recognition ===

A common evaluation set for image classification is the MNIST database data set",Deep Learning
"MNIST is composed of handwritten digits and includes 60,000 training examples and 10,000 test examples",Deep Learning
"As with TIMIT, its small size lets users test multiple configurations",Deep Learning
"A comprehensive list of results on this set is available.
Deep learning-based image recognition has become ""superhuman"", producing more accurate results than human contestants",Deep Learning
"This first occurred in 2011 in recognition of traffic signs, and in 2014, with recognition of human faces.
Deep learning-trained vehicles now interpret 360° camera views",Deep Learning
"Another example is Facial Dysmorphology Novel Analysis (FDNA) used to analyze cases of human malformation connected to a large database of genetic syndromes.


=== Visual art processing ===

Closely related to the progress that has been made in image recognition is the increasing application of deep learning techniques to various visual art tasks",Deep Learning
"DNNs have proven themselves capable, for example, of

identifying the style period of a given painting
Neural Style Transfer –  capturing the style of a given artwork and applying it in a visually pleasing manner to an arbitrary photograph or video
generating striking imagery based on random visual input fields.


=== Natural language processing ===

Neural networks have been used for implementing language models since the early 2000s",Deep Learning
"LSTM helped to improve machine translation and language modeling.
Other key techniques in this field are negative sampling and word embedding",Deep Learning
"Word embedding, such as word2vec, can be thought of as a representational layer in a deep learning architecture that transforms an atomic word into a positional representation of the word relative to other words in the dataset; the position is represented as a point in a vector space",Deep Learning
Using word embedding as an RNN input layer allows the network to parse sentences and phrases using an effective compositional vector grammar,Deep Learning
A compositional vector grammar can be thought of as probabilistic context free grammar (PCFG) implemented by an RNN,Deep Learning
Recursive auto-encoders built atop word embeddings can assess sentence similarity and detect paraphrasing,Deep Learning
"Deep neural architectures provide the best results for constituency parsing, sentiment analysis, information retrieval, spoken language understanding, machine translation, contextual entity linking, writing style recognition, named-entity recognition (token classification), text classification, and others.
Recent developments generalize word embedding to sentence embedding.
Google Translate (GT) uses a large end-to-end long short-term memory (LSTM) network",Deep Learning
"Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) uses an example-based machine translation method in which the system ""learns from millions of examples""",Deep Learning
"It translates ""whole sentences at a time, rather than pieces""",Deep Learning
"The network encodes the ""semantics of the sentence rather than simply memorizing phrase-to-phrase translations""",Deep Learning
"GT uses English as an intermediate between most language pairs.


=== Drug discovery and toxicology ===

A large percentage of candidate drugs fail to win regulatory approval",Deep Learning
"These failures are caused by insufficient efficacy (on-target effect), undesired interactions (off-target effects), or unanticipated toxic effects",Deep Learning
"Research has explored use of deep learning to predict the biomolecular targets, off-targets, and toxic effects of environmental chemicals in nutrients, household products and drugs.
AtomNet is a deep learning system for structure-based rational drug design",Deep Learning
"AtomNet was used to predict novel candidate biomolecules for disease targets such as the Ebola virus and multiple sclerosis.
In 2017 graph neural networks were used for the first time to predict various properties of molecules in a large toxicology data set",Deep Learning
"In 2019, generative neural networks were used to produce molecules that were validated experimentally all the way into mice.


=== Customer relationship management ===

Deep reinforcement learning has been used to approximate the value of possible direct marketing actions, defined in terms of RFM variables",Deep Learning
"The estimated value function was shown to have a natural interpretation as customer lifetime value.


=== Recommendation systems ===

Recommendation systems have used deep learning to extract meaningful features for a latent factor model for content-based music and journal recommendations",Deep Learning
Multi-view deep learning has been applied for learning user preferences from multiple domains,Deep Learning
"The model uses a hybrid collaborative and content-based approach and enhances recommendations in multiple tasks.


=== Bioinformatics ===

An autoencoder ANN was used in bioinformatics, to predict gene ontology annotations and gene-function relationships.
In medical informatics, deep learning was used to predict sleep quality based on data from wearables and predictions of health complications from electronic health record data.
Deep neural networks have shown unparalleled performance in predicting protein structure, according to the sequence of the amino acids that make it up",Deep Learning
"In 2020, AlphaFold, a deep-learning based system, achieved a level of accuracy significantly higher than all previous computational methods.


=== Deep Neural Network Estimations ===
Deep neural networks can be used to estimate the entropy of a stochastic process and called Neural Joint Entropy Estimator (NJEE)",Deep Learning
Such an estimation provides insights on the effects of input random variables on an independent random variable,Deep Learning
"Practically, the DNN is trained as a classifier that maps an input vector or matrix X to an output probability distribution over the possible classes of random variable Y, given input X",Deep Learning
"For example, in image classification tasks, the NJEE maps a vector of pixels' color values to probabilities over possible image classes",Deep Learning
"In practice, the probability distribution of Y is obtained by a Softmax layer with number of nodes that is equal to the alphabet size of Y",Deep Learning
"NJEE uses continuously differentiable activation functions, such that the conditions for the universal approximation theorem holds",Deep Learning
"It is shown that this method provides a strongly consistent estimator and outperforms other methods in case of large alphabet sizes.


=== Medical image analysis ===
Deep learning has been shown to produce competitive results in medical application such as cancer cell classification, lesion detection, organ segmentation and image enhancement",Deep Learning
"Modern deep learning tools demonstrate the high accuracy of detecting various diseases and the helpfulness of their use by specialists to improve the diagnosis efficiency.


=== Mobile advertising ===
Finding the appropriate mobile audience for mobile advertising is always challenging, since many data points must be considered and analyzed before a target segment can be created and used in ad serving by any ad server",Deep Learning
"Deep learning has been used to interpret large, many-dimensioned advertising datasets",Deep Learning
Many data points are collected during the request/serve/click internet advertising cycle,Deep Learning
"This information can form the basis of machine learning to improve ad selection.


=== Image restoration ===
Deep learning has been successfully applied to inverse problems such as denoising, super-resolution, inpainting, and film colorization",Deep Learning
"These applications include learning methods such as ""Shrinkage Fields for Effective Image Restoration"" which trains on an image dataset, and Deep Image Prior, which trains on the image that needs restoration.


=== Financial fraud detection ===
Deep learning is being successfully applied to financial fraud detection, tax evasion detection, and anti-money laundering.


=== Materials science ===
In November 2023, researchers at Google DeepMind and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory announced that they had developed an AI system known as GNoME",Deep Learning
This system has contributed to materials science by discovering over 2 million new materials within a relatively short timeframe,Deep Learning
"GNoME employs deep learning techniques to efficiently explore potential material structures, achieving a significant increase in the identification of stable inorganic crystal structures",Deep Learning
"The system's predictions were validated through autonomous robotic experiments, demonstrating a noteworthy success rate of 71%",Deep Learning
"The data of newly discovered materials is publicly available through the Materials Project database, offering researchers the opportunity to identify materials with desired properties for various applications",Deep Learning
"This development has implications for the future of scientific discovery and the integration of AI in material science research, potentially expediting material innovation and reducing costs in product development",Deep Learning
"The use of AI and deep learning suggests the possibility of minimizing or eliminating manual lab experiments and allowing scientists to focus more on the design and analysis of unique compounds.


=== Military ===
The United States Department of Defense applied deep learning to train robots in new tasks through observation.


=== Partial differential equations ===
Physics informed neural networks have been used to solve partial differential equations in both forward and inverse problems in a data driven manner",Deep Learning
One example is the reconstructing fluid flow governed by the Navier-Stokes equations,Deep Learning
"Using physics informed neural networks does not require the often expensive mesh generation that conventional CFD methods relies on.


=== Deep backward stochastic differential equation method ===
Deep backward stochastic differential equation method is a numerical method that combines deep learning with Backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE)",Deep Learning
This method is particularly useful for solving high-dimensional problems in financial mathematics,Deep Learning
"By leveraging the powerful function approximation capabilities of deep neural networks, deep BSDE addresses the computational challenges faced by traditional numerical methods in high-dimensional settings",Deep Learning
"Specifically, traditional methods like finite difference methods or Monte Carlo simulations often struggle with the curse of dimensionality, where computational cost increases exponentially with the number of dimensions",Deep Learning
"Deep BSDE methods, however, employ deep neural networks to approximate solutions of high-dimensional partial differential equations (PDEs), effectively reducing the computational burden.
In addition, the integration of Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) into the deep BSDE framework enhances its capability by embedding the underlying physical laws directly into the neural network architecture",Deep Learning
This ensures that the solutions not only fit the data but also adhere to the governing stochastic differential equations,Deep Learning
"PINNs leverage the power of deep learning while respecting the constraints imposed by the physical models, resulting in more accurate and reliable solutions for financial mathematics problems.


=== Image reconstruction ===
Image reconstruction is the reconstruction of the underlying images from the image-related measurements",Deep Learning
"Several works showed the better and superior performance of the deep learning methods compared to analytical methods for various applications, e.g., spectral imaging  and ultrasound imaging.


=== Weather prediction ===
Traditional weather prediction systems solve a very complex system of partial differential equations",Deep Learning
"GraphCast is a deep learning based model, trained on a long history of weather data to predict how weather patterns change over time",Deep Learning
"It is able to  predict weather conditions for up to 10 days globally, at a very detailed level, and in under a minute, with precision similar to state of the art systems.


=== Epigenetic clock ===

An epigenetic clock is a biochemical test that can be used to measure age",Deep Learning
"used deep neural networks to train an epigenetic aging clock of unprecedented accuracy using >6,000 blood samples",Deep Learning
"The clock uses information from 1000 CpG sites and predicts people with certain conditions older than healthy controls: IBD, frontotemporal dementia, ovarian cancer, obesity",Deep Learning
"The aging clock was planned to be released for public use in 2021 by an Insilico Medicine spinoff company Deep Longevity.


== Relation to human cognitive and brain development ==
Deep learning is closely related to a class of theories of brain development (specifically, neocortical development) proposed by cognitive neuroscientists in the early 1990s",Deep Learning
"These developmental theories were instantiated in computational models, making them predecessors of deep learning systems",Deep Learning
"These developmental models share the property that various proposed learning dynamics in the brain (e.g., a wave of nerve growth factor) support the self-organization somewhat analogous to the neural networks utilized in deep learning models",Deep Learning
"Like the neocortex, neural networks employ a hierarchy of layered filters in which each layer considers information from a prior layer (or the operating environment), and then passes its output (and possibly the original input), to other layers",Deep Learning
"This process yields a self-organizing stack of transducers, well-tuned to their operating environment",Deep Learning
"A 1995 description stated, ""...the infant's brain seems to organize itself under the influence of waves of so-called trophic-factors ..",Deep Learning
"different regions of the brain become connected sequentially, with one layer of tissue maturing before another and so on until the whole brain is mature"".
A variety of approaches have been used to investigate the plausibility of deep learning models from a neurobiological perspective",Deep Learning
"On the one hand, several variants of the backpropagation algorithm have been proposed in order to increase its processing realism",Deep Learning
"Other researchers have argued that unsupervised forms of deep learning, such as those based on hierarchical generative models and deep belief networks, may be closer to biological reality",Deep Learning
"In this respect, generative neural network models have been related to neurobiological evidence about sampling-based processing in the cerebral cortex.
Although a systematic comparison between the human brain organization and the neuronal encoding in deep networks has not yet been established, several analogies have been reported",Deep Learning
"For example, the computations performed by deep learning units could be similar to those of actual neurons and neural populations",Deep Learning
"Similarly, the representations developed by deep learning models are similar to those measured in the primate visual system both at the single-unit and at the population levels.


== Commercial activity ==
Facebook's AI lab performs tasks such as automatically tagging uploaded pictures with the names of the people in them.
Google's DeepMind Technologies developed a system capable of learning how to play Atari video games using only pixels as data input",Deep Learning
"In 2015 they demonstrated their AlphaGo system, which learned the game of Go well enough to beat a professional Go player",Deep Learning
"Google Translate uses a neural network to translate between more than 100 languages.
In 2017, Covariant.ai was launched, which focuses on integrating deep learning into factories.
As of 2008, researchers at The University of Texas at Austin (UT) developed a machine learning framework called Training an Agent Manually via Evaluative Reinforcement, or TAMER, which proposed new methods for robots or computer programs to learn how to perform tasks by interacting with a human instructor",Deep Learning
"First developed as TAMER, a new algorithm called Deep TAMER was later introduced in 2018 during a collaboration between U.S",Deep Learning
Deep TAMER used deep learning to provide a robot with the ability to learn new tasks through observation,Deep Learning
"Using Deep TAMER, a robot learned a task with a human trainer, watching video streams or observing a human perform a task in-person",Deep Learning
"The robot later practiced the task with the help of some coaching from the trainer, who provided feedback such as ""good job"" and ""bad job"".


== Criticism and comment ==
Deep learning has attracted both criticism and comment, in some cases from outside the field of computer science.


=== Theory ===

A main criticism concerns the lack of theory surrounding some methods",Deep Learning
Learning in the most common deep architectures is implemented using well-understood gradient descent,Deep Learning
"However, the theory surrounding other algorithms, such as contrastive divergence is less clear",Deep Learning
"(e.g., Does it converge? If so, how fast? What is it approximating?) Deep learning methods are often looked at as a black box, with most confirmations done empirically, rather than theoretically.
Others point out that deep learning should be looked at as a step towards realizing strong AI, not as an all-encompassing solution",Deep Learning
"Despite the power of deep learning methods, they still lack much of the functionality needed to realize this goal entirely",Deep Learning
"Research psychologist Gary Marcus noted:

Realistically, deep learning is only part of the larger challenge of building intelligent machines",Deep Learning
"Such techniques lack ways of representing causal relationships (...) have no obvious ways of performing logical inferences, and they are also still a long way from integrating abstract knowledge, such as information about what objects are, what they are for, and how they are typically used",Deep Learning
"systems, like Watson (...) use techniques like deep learning as just one element in a very complicated ensemble of techniques, ranging from the statistical technique of Bayesian inference to deductive reasoning.

In further reference to the idea that artistic sensitivity might be inherent in relatively low levels of the cognitive hierarchy, a published series of graphic representations of the internal states of deep (20-30 layers) neural networks attempting to discern within essentially random data the images on which they were trained demonstrate a visual appeal: the original research notice received well over 1,000 comments, and was the subject of what was for a time the most frequently accessed article on The Guardian's website.


=== Errors ===
Some deep learning architectures display problematic behaviors, such as confidently classifying unrecognizable images as belonging to a familiar category of ordinary images (2014) and misclassifying minuscule perturbations of correctly classified images (2013)",Deep Learning
Goertzel hypothesized that these behaviors are due to limitations in their internal representations and that these limitations would inhibit integration into heterogeneous multi-component artificial general intelligence (AGI) architectures,Deep Learning
These issues may possibly be addressed by deep learning architectures that internally form states homologous to image-grammar decompositions of observed entities and events,Deep Learning
"Learning a grammar (visual or linguistic) from training data would be equivalent to restricting the system to commonsense reasoning that operates on concepts in terms of grammatical production rules and is a basic goal of both human language acquisition and artificial intelligence (AI).


=== Cyber threat ===
As deep learning moves from the lab into the world, research and experience show that artificial neural networks are vulnerable to hacks and deception",Deep Learning
"By identifying patterns that these systems use to function, attackers can modify inputs to ANNs in such a way that the ANN finds a match that human observers would not recognize",Deep Learning
"For example, an attacker can make subtle changes to an image such that the ANN finds a match even though the image looks to a human nothing like the search target",Deep Learning
"Such manipulation is termed an ""adversarial attack"".
In 2016 researchers used one ANN to doctor images in trial and error fashion, identify another's focal points, and thereby generate images that deceived it",Deep Learning
Another group showed that printouts of doctored images then photographed successfully tricked an image classification system,Deep Learning
"One defense is reverse image search, in which a possible fake image is submitted to a site such as TinEye that can then find other instances of it",Deep Learning
"A refinement is to search using only parts of the image, to identify images from which that piece may have been taken.
Another group showed that certain psychedelic spectacles could fool a facial recognition system into thinking ordinary people were celebrities, potentially allowing one person to impersonate another",Deep Learning
"In 2017 researchers added stickers to stop signs and caused an ANN to misclassify them.
ANNs can however be further trained to detect attempts at deception, potentially leading attackers and defenders into an arms race similar to the kind that already defines the malware defense industry",Deep Learning
"ANNs have been trained to defeat ANN-based anti-malware software by repeatedly attacking a defense with malware that was continually altered by a genetic algorithm until it tricked the anti-malware while retaining its ability to damage the target.
In 2016, another group demonstrated that certain sounds could make the Google Now voice command system open a particular web address, and hypothesized that this could ""serve as a stepping stone for further attacks (e.g., opening a web page hosting drive-by malware)"".
In ""data poisoning"", false data is continually smuggled into a machine learning system's training set to prevent it from achieving mastery.


=== Data collection ethics ===

Most Deep Learning systems rely on training and verification data that is generated and/or annotated by humans",Deep Learning
It has been argued in media philosophy that not only low-paid clickwork (e.g,Deep Learning
"on Amazon Mechanical Turk) is regularly deployed for this purpose, but also implicit forms of human microwork that are often not recognized as such",Deep Learning
"The philosopher Rainer Mühlhoff distinguishes five types of ""machinic capture"" of human microwork to generate training data: (1) gamification (the embedding of annotation or computation tasks in the flow of a game), (2) ""trapping and tracking"" (e.g",Deep Learning
"CAPTCHAs for image recognition or click-tracking on Google search results pages), (3) exploitation of social motivations (e.g",Deep Learning
"tagging faces on Facebook to obtain labeled facial images), (4) information mining (e.g",Deep Learning
"by leveraging quantified-self devices such as activity trackers) and (5) clickwork.
Mühlhoff argues that in most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning such as Facebook's face recognition system, the need for training data does not stop once an ANN is trained",Deep Learning
"Rather, there is a continued demand for human-generated verification data to constantly calibrate and update the ANN",Deep Learning
"For this purpose, Facebook introduced the feature that once a user is automatically recognized in an image, they receive a notification",Deep Learning
"They can choose whether or not they like to be publicly labeled on the image, or tell Facebook that it is not them in the picture",Deep Learning
"This user interface is a mechanism to generate ""a constant stream of verification data"" to further train the network in real-time",Deep Learning
"As Mühlhoff argues, the involvement of human users to generate training and verification data is so typical for most commercial end-user applications of Deep Learning that such systems may be referred to as ""human-aided artificial intelligence"".

An electric vehicle (EV) is a vehicle whose propulsion is powered fully or mostly by electricity,Electric Vehicles
"EVs include road and rail vehicles, electric boats and underwater vessels, electric aircraft and electric spacecraft.
Early electric vehicles first came into existence in the late 19th century, when the Second Industrial Revolution brought forth electrification",Electric Vehicles
"Using electricity was among the preferred methods for motor vehicle propulsion as it provides a level of quietness, comfort and ease of operation that could not be achieved by the gasoline engine cars of the time, but range anxiety due to the limited energy storage offered by contemporary battery technologies hindered any mass adoption of private electric vehicles throughout the 20th century",Electric Vehicles
"Internal combustion engines (both gasoline and diesel engines) were the dominant propulsion mechanisms for cars and trucks for about 100 years, but electricity-powered locomotion remained commonplace in other vehicle types, such as overhead line-powered mass transit vehicles like electric trains, trams, monorails and trolley buses, as well as various small, low-speed, short-range battery-powered personal vehicles such as mobility scooters.

Hybrid electric vehicles, where electric motors are used as a supplementary propulsion to internal combustion engines, became more widespread in the late 1990s",Electric Vehicles
"Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, where electric motors can be used as the predominant propulsion rather than a supplement, did not see any mass production until the late 2000s, and battery electric cars did not become practical options for the consumer market until the 2010s.
Progress in batteries, electric motors and power electronics have made electric cars more feasible than during the 20th century",Electric Vehicles
"As a means of reducing tailpipe emissions of carbon dioxide and other pollutants, and to reduce use of fossil fuels, government incentives are available in many areas to promote the adoption of electric cars and trucks.


== History ==

Electric motive power started in 1827 when Hungarian priest Ányos Jedlik built the first crude but viable electric motor; the next year he used it to power a small model car",Electric Vehicles
"In 1835, Professor Sibrandus Stratingh of the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, built a small-scale electric car, and sometime between 1832 and 1839, Robert Anderson of Scotland invented the first crude electric carriage, powered by non-rechargeable primary cells",Electric Vehicles
"American blacksmith and inventor Thomas Davenport built a toy electric locomotive, powered by a primitive electric motor, in 1835",Electric Vehicles
"In 1838, a Scotsman named Robert Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of four miles per hour (6 km/h)",Electric Vehicles
"In England, a patent was granted in 1840 for the use of rails as conductors of electric current, and similar American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in 1847.

The first mass-produced electric vehicles appeared in America in the early 1900s",Electric Vehicles
"In 1902, the Studebaker Automobile Company entered the automotive business with electric vehicles, though it also entered the gasoline vehicles market in 1904",Electric Vehicles
"However, with the advent of cheap assembly line cars by Ford Motor Company, the popularity of electric cars declined significantly.
Due to lack of electricity grids and the limitations of storage batteries at that time, electric cars did not gain much popularity; however, electric trains gained immense popularity due to their economies and achievable speeds",Electric Vehicles
"By the 20th century, electric rail transport became commonplace due to advances in the development of electric locomotives",Electric Vehicles
"Over time their general-purpose commercial use reduced to specialist roles as platform trucks, forklift trucks, ambulances, tow tractors, and urban delivery vehicles, such as the iconic British milk float",Electric Vehicles
"For most of the 20th century, the UK was the world's largest user of electric road vehicles.
Electrified trains were used for coal transport, as the motors did not use the valuable oxygen in the mines",Electric Vehicles
Switzerland's lack of natural fossil resources forced the rapid electrification of their rail network,Electric Vehicles
"One of the earliest rechargeable batteries – the nickel-iron battery – was favored by Edison for use in electric cars.
EVs were among the earliest automobiles, and before the preeminence of light, powerful internal combustion engines (ICEs), electric automobiles held many vehicle land speed and distance records in the early 1900s",Electric Vehicles
"They were produced by Baker Electric, Columbia Electric, Detroit Electric, and others, and at one point in history outsold gasoline-powered vehicles",Electric Vehicles
"In 1900, 28 percent of the cars on the road in the US were electric",Electric Vehicles
"EVs were so popular that even President Woodrow Wilson and his secret service agents toured Washington, D.C., in their Milburn Electrics, which covered 60–70 miles (100–110 km) per charge.

Most producers of passenger cars opted for gasoline cars in the first decade of the 20th century, but electric trucks were an established niche well into the 1920s",Electric Vehicles
A number of developments contributed to a decline in the popularity of electric cars,Electric Vehicles
" Improved road infrastructure required a greater range than that offered by electric cars, and the discovery of large reserves of petroleum in Texas, Oklahoma, and California led to the wide availability of affordable gasoline/petrol, making internal combustion powered cars cheaper to operate over long distances",Electric Vehicles
"Electric vehicles were seldom marketed as a women's luxury car, which may have been a stigma among male consumers",Electric Vehicles
"Also, internal combustion powered cars became ever-easier to operate thanks to the invention of the electric starter by Charles Kettering in 1912, which eliminated the need of a hand crank for starting a gasoline engine, and the noise emitted by ICE cars became more bearable thanks to the use of the muffler, which Hiram Percy Maxim had invented in 1897",Electric Vehicles
"As roads were improved outside urban areas, electric vehicle range could not compete with the ICE",Electric Vehicles
"Finally, the initiation of mass production of gasoline-powered vehicles by Henry Ford in 1913 reduced significantly the cost of gasoline cars as compared to electric cars.
In the 1930s, National City Lines, which was a partnership of General Motors, Firestone, and Standard Oil of California purchased many electric tram networks across the country to dismantle them and replace them with GM buses",Electric Vehicles
"The partnership was convicted of conspiring to monopolize the sale of equipment and supplies to their subsidiary companies, but was acquitted of conspiring to monopolize the provision of transportation services.
The Copenhagen Summit, which was conducted in the midst of a severe observable climate change brought on by human-made greenhouse gas emissions, was held in 2009",Electric Vehicles
"During the summit, more than 70 countries developed plans to eventually reach net zero",Electric Vehicles
"For many countries, adopting more EVs will help reduce the use of gasoline.


=== Experimentation ===

In January 1990, General Motors President introduced its EV concept two-seater, the ""Impact"", at the Los Angeles Auto Show",Electric Vehicles
"That September, the California Air Resources Board mandated major-automaker sales of EVs, in phases starting in 1998",Electric Vehicles
"From 1996 to 1998 GM produced 1117 EV1s, 800 of which were made available through three-year leases.
Chrysler, Ford, GM, Honda, and Toyota also produced limited numbers of EVs for California drivers during this time period",Electric Vehicles
"In 2003, upon the expiration of GM's EV1 leases, GM discontinued them",Electric Vehicles
"The discontinuation has variously been attributed to:

the auto industry's successful federal court challenge to California's zero-emissions vehicle mandate,
a federal regulation requiring GM to produce and maintain spare parts for the few thousand EV1s and
the success of the oil and auto industries' media campaign to reduce public acceptance of EVs.
A movie made on the subject in 2005–2006 was titled Who Killed the Electric Car? and released theatrically by Sony Pictures Classics in 2006",Electric Vehicles
"The film explores the roles of automobile manufacturers, oil industry, the U.S",Electric Vehicles
"government, batteries, hydrogen vehicles, and the general public, and each of their roles in limiting the deployment and adoption of this technology.
Ford released a number of their Ford Ecostar delivery vans into the market",Electric Vehicles
"Honda, Nissan and Toyota also repossessed and crushed most of their EVs, which, like the GM EV1s, had been available only by closed-end lease",Electric Vehicles
"After public protests, Toyota sold 200 of its RAV4 EVs; they later sold at over their original forty-thousand-dollar price",Electric Vehicles
"Later, BMW of Canada sold off a number of Mini EVs when their Canadian testing ended.
The production of the Citroën Berlingo Electrique stopped in September 2005",Electric Vehicles
"Zenn started production in 2006 but ended by 2009.


=== Reintroduction ===

During the late 20th and early 21st century, the environmental impact of the petroleum-based transportation infrastructure, along with the fear of peak oil, led to renewed interest in electric transportation infrastructure",Electric Vehicles
"EVs differ from fossil fuel-powered vehicles in that the electricity they consume can be generated from a wide range of sources, including fossil fuels, nuclear power, and renewables such as solar power and wind power, or any combination of those",Electric Vehicles
"Recent advancements in battery technology and charging infrastructure have addressed many of the earlier barriers to EV adoption, making electric vehicles a more viable option for a wider range of consumers.
The carbon footprint and other emissions of electric vehicles vary depending on the fuel and technology used for electricity generation",Electric Vehicles
"The electricity may be stored in the vehicle using a battery, flywheel, or supercapacitors",Electric Vehicles
"Vehicles using internal combustion engines usually only derive their energy from a single or a few sources, usually non-renewable fossil fuels",Electric Vehicles
"A key advantage of electric vehicles is regenerative braking, which recovers kinetic energy, typically lost during friction braking as heat, as electricity restored to the on-board battery.


== Electricity sources ==
There are many ways to generate electricity, of varying costs, efficiency and ecological desirability.


=== Connection to generator plants ===
Direct connection to electric grids as is common among electric trains, trams, trolleybuses, and trolleytrucks (See also: overhead lines, third rail and conduit current collection)
Online electric vehicle collects power from electric power strips buried under the road surface through electromagnetic induction


=== Onboard generators and hybrid EVs ===

Generated on-board using a diesel engine: diesel–electric locomotive and diesel–electric multiple unit (DEMU)
Generated on-board using a fuel cell: fuel cell vehicle
Generated on-board using nuclear energy: nuclear submarines and aircraft carriers
Renewable sources such as solar power: solar vehicle
It is also possible to have hybrid EVs that derive electricity from multiple sources, such as:

On-board rechargeable electricity storage system (RESS) and a direct continuous connection to land-based generation plants for purposes of on-highway recharging with unrestricted highway range
On-board rechargeable electricity storage system and a fueled propulsion power source (internal combustion engine): plug-in hybrid
For especially large EVs, such as submarines, the chemical energy of the diesel–electric can be replaced by a nuclear reactor",Electric Vehicles
"The nuclear reactor usually provides heat, which drives a steam turbine, which drives a generator, which is then fed to the propulsion",Electric Vehicles
"See Nuclear marine propulsion.
A few experimental vehicles, such as some cars and a handful of aircraft use solar panels for electricity.


=== Onboard storage ===

These systems are powered from an external generator plant (nearly always when stationary), and then disconnected before motion occurs, and the electricity is stored in the vehicle until needed.

Full Electric Vehicles (FEV)",Electric Vehicles
"Power storage methods include:
Chemical energy stored on the vehicle in on-board batteries: Battery electric vehicle (BEV) typically with a lithium-ion battery
Kinetic energy storage: flywheels
Static energy stored on the vehicle in on-board electric double-layer capacitors
Batteries, electric double-layer capacitors and flywheel energy storage are forms of rechargeable on-board electricity storage systems",Electric Vehicles
"By avoiding an intermediate mechanical step, the energy conversion efficiency can be improved compared to hybrids by avoiding unnecessary energy conversions",Electric Vehicles
"Furthermore, electro-chemical batteries conversions are reversible, allowing electrical energy to be stored in chemical form.


== Lithium-ion battery ==

Most electric vehicles use lithium-ion batteries (Li-Ions or LIBs)",Electric Vehicles
"Lithium-ion batteries have a higher energy density, longer life span, and higher power density than most other practical batteries",Electric Vehicles
"Complicating factors include safety, durability, thermal breakdown,  environmental impact, and cost",Electric Vehicles
"Li-ion batteries should be used within safe temperature and voltage ranges to operate safely and efficiently.
Increasing the battery's lifespan decreases effective costs and environmental impact",Electric Vehicles
"One technique is to operate a subset of the battery cells at a time and switching these subsets.
In the past, nickel–metal hydride batteries were used in some electric cars, such as those made by General Motors",Electric Vehicles
These battery types are considered outdated due to their tendencies to self-discharge in the heat,Electric Vehicles
"Furthermore, a patent for this type of battery was held by Chevron, which created a problem for their widespread development",Electric Vehicles
"These factors, coupled with their high cost, has led to lithium-ion batteries leading as the predominant battery for EVs.
The prices of lithium-ion batteries have declined dramatically over the past decade, contributing to a reduction in price for electric vehicles, but an increase in the price of critical minerals such as lithium from 2021 to the end of 2022 has put pressure on historical battery price decreases.


== Electric motor ==

The power of a vehicle's electric motor, as in other machines, is measured in kilowatts (kW)",Electric Vehicles
Electric motors can deliver their maximum torque over a wide RPM range,Electric Vehicles
"This means that the performance of a vehicle with a 100 kW electric motor exceeds that of a vehicle with a 100 kW internal combustion engine, which can only deliver its maximum torque within a limited range of engine speed.
Efficiency of charging varies considerably depending on the type of charger, and energy is lost during the process of converting the electrical energy to mechanical energy.
Usually, direct current (DC) electricity is fed into a DC/AC inverter where it is converted to alternating current (AC) electricity and this AC electricity is connected to a 3-phase AC motor.
For electric trains, forklift trucks, and some electric cars, DC motors are often used",Electric Vehicles
"In some cases, universal motors are used, and then AC or DC may be employed",Electric Vehicles
"In recent production vehicles, various motor types have been implemented; for instance, induction motors within Tesla Motor vehicles and permanent magnet machines in the Nissan Leaf and Chevrolet Bolt.


== Energy and motors ==

Most large electric transport systems are powered by stationary sources of electricity that are directly connected to the vehicles through wires",Electric Vehicles
"Electric traction allows the use of regenerative braking, in which the motors are used as brakes and become generators that transform the motion of, usually, a train into electrical power that is then fed back into the lines",Electric Vehicles
"This system is particularly advantageous in mountainous operations, as descending vehicles can produce a large portion of the power required for those ascending",Electric Vehicles
"This regenerative system is only viable if the system is large enough to use the power generated by descending vehicles.
In the systems above, motion is provided by a rotary electric motor",Electric Vehicles
"However, it is possible to ""unroll"" the motor to drive directly against a special matched track",Electric Vehicles
These linear motors are used in maglev trains which float above the rails supported by magnetic levitation,Electric Vehicles
This allows for almost no rolling resistance of the vehicle and no mechanical wear and tear of the train or track,Electric Vehicles
"In addition to the high-performance control systems needed, switching and curving of the tracks becomes difficult with linear motors, which to date has restricted their operations to high-speed point to point services.


== Vehicle types ==

It is generally possible to equip any kind of vehicle with an electric power-train.


=== Ground vehicles ===


==== Pure-electric vehicles ====

A pure-electric vehicle or all-electric vehicle is powered exclusively through electric motors",Electric Vehicles
"The electricity may come from a battery (battery electric vehicle), solar panel (solar vehicle) or fuel cell (fuel cell vehicle).


==== Hybrid EVs ====

There are different ways that a hybrid electric vehicle can combine the power from an electric motor and the internal combustion engine",Electric Vehicles
The most common type is a parallel hybrid that connects the engine and the electric motor to the wheels through mechanical coupling,Electric Vehicles
"In this scenario, the electric motor and the engine can drive the wheels directly",Electric Vehicles
Series hybrids only use the electric motor to drive the wheels and can often be referred to as extended-range electric vehicles (EREVs) or range-extended electric vehicles (REEVs),Electric Vehicles
"There are also series-parallel hybrids where the vehicle can be powered by the engine working alone, the electric motor on its own, or by both working together; this is designed so that the engine can run at its optimum range as often as possible.


==== Plug-in electric vehicle ====

A plug-in electric vehicle (PEV) is any motor vehicle that can be recharged from any external source of electricity, such as wall sockets, and the electricity stored in the Rechargeable battery packs drives or contributes to drive the wheels",Electric Vehicles
"PEV is a subcategory of electric vehicles that includes battery electric vehicles (BEVs), plug-in hybrid vehicles, (PHEVs), and electric vehicle conversions of hybrid electric vehicles and conventional internal combustion engine vehicles.


==== Range-extended electric vehicle ====

A range-extended electric vehicle (REEV) is a vehicle powered by an electric motor and a plug-in battery",Electric Vehicles
"An auxiliary combustion engine is used only to supplement battery charging and not as the primary source of power.


==== On- and off-road EVs ====
On-road electric vehicles include electric cars, electric trolleybuses, electric buses, battery electric buses, electric trucks, electric bicycles, electric motorcycles and scooters, personal transporters, neighborhood electric vehicles, golf carts, milk floats, and forklifts",Electric Vehicles
"Off-road vehicles include electrified all-terrain vehicles and electric tractors.


==== Railborne EVs ====

The fixed nature of a rail line makes it relatively easy to power EVs through permanent overhead lines or electrified third rails, eliminating the need for heavy onboard batteries",Electric Vehicles
"Electric locomotives, electric multiple units, electric trams (also called streetcars or trolleys), electric light rail systems, and electric rapid transit are all in common use today, especially in Europe and Asia.
Since electric trains do not need to carry a heavy internal combustion engine or large batteries, they can have very good power-to-weight ratios",Electric Vehicles
"This allows high speed trains such as France's double-deck TGVs to operate at speeds of 320 km/h (200 mph) or higher, and electric locomotives to have a much higher power output than diesel locomotives",Electric Vehicles
"In addition, they have higher short-term surge power for fast acceleration, and using regenerative brakes can put braking power back into the electrical grid rather than wasting it.
Maglev trains are also nearly always EVs.
There are also battery electric passenger trains operating on non-electrified rail lines.


=== Seaborne EVs ===

Electric boats were popular around the turn of the 20th century",Electric Vehicles
"Interest in quiet and potentially renewable marine transportation has steadily increased since the late 20th century, as solar cells have given motorboats the infinite range of sailboats",Electric Vehicles
Electric motors can and have also been used in sailboats instead of traditional diesel engines,Electric Vehicles
"Submarines use batteries (charged by diesel or gasoline engines at the surface), nuclear power, fuel cells or Stirling engines to run electric motor-driven propellers",Electric Vehicles
"Fully electric tugboats are being used in Auckland, New Zealand (June 2022), Vancouver, British Columbia (October 2023), and San Diego, California.


=== Airborne EVs ===

Since the beginnings of aviation, electric power for aircraft has received a great deal of experimentation",Electric Vehicles
"Currently, flying electric aircraft include piloted and unpiloted aerial vehicles.


=== Electrically powered spacecraft ===

Electric power has a long history of use in spacecraft",Electric Vehicles
"The power sources used for spacecraft are batteries, solar panels and nuclear power",Electric Vehicles
"Current methods of propelling a spacecraft with electricity include the arcjet rocket, the electrostatic ion thruster, the Hall-effect thruster, and Field Emission Electric Propulsion.


==== Space rover vehicles ====

Crewed and uncrewed vehicles have been used to explore the Moon and other planets in the Solar System",Electric Vehicles
"On the last three missions of the Apollo program in 1971 and 1972, astronauts drove silver-oxide battery-powered Lunar Roving Vehicles distances up to 35.7 kilometers (22.2 mi) on the lunar surface",Electric Vehicles
"Uncrewed, solar-powered rovers have explored the Moon and Mars.


== Records ==

Rimac Nevera, an electric hypercar, set 23 world speed records in one day.
Fastest acceleration of an electric car, 0 to 100 km/h in 1.461 seconds by university students at the University of Stuttgart.
Electric Land Speed Record 353 mph (568 km/h).
Electric Car Distance Record 1,725 miles (2,776 km) in 24 hours by Bjørn Nyland.
Greatest distance by electric vehicle, single charge 999.5 miles (1,608.5 km).
Solar-powered EV is fastest EV to go over 1,000 km without stopping to recharge, the Sunswift 7.
Electric Motorcycle: 1,070 miles (1,720 km) under 24 hours",Electric Vehicles
"Michel von Tell on a Harley LiveWire.
Electric flight: 439.5 miles (707.3 km) without charge.


== Properties ==


=== Components ===
The type of battery, the type of traction motor and the motor controller design vary according to the size, power and proposed application, which can be as small as a motorized shopping cart or wheelchair, through pedelecs, electric motorcycles and scooters, neighborhood electric vehicles, industrial fork-lift trucks and including many hybrid vehicles.


=== Energy sources ===
EVs are much more efficient than fossil fuel vehicles and have few direct emissions",Electric Vehicles
"At the same time, they do rely on electrical energy that is generally provided by a combination of non-fossil fuel plants and fossil fuel plants",Electric Vehicles
"Consequently, EVs can be made less polluting overall by modifying the source of electricity",Electric Vehicles
"In some areas, persons can ask utilities to provide their electricity from renewable energy.
Fossil fuel vehicle efficiency and pollution standards take years to filter through a nation's fleet of vehicles",Electric Vehicles
"New efficiency and pollution standards rely on the purchase of new vehicles, often as the current vehicles already on the road reach their end-of-life",Electric Vehicles
"Only a few nations set a retirement age for old vehicles, such as Japan or Singapore, forcing periodic upgrading of all vehicles already on the road.


=== Batteries ===

An electric-vehicle battery (EVB) in addition to the traction battery specialty systems used for industrial (or recreational) vehicles, are batteries used to power the propulsion system of a battery electric vehicle (BEVs)",Electric Vehicles
"These batteries are usually a secondary (rechargeable) battery, and are typically lithium-ion batteries.
Traction batteries, specifically designed with a high ampere-hour capacity, are used in forklifts, electric golf carts, riding floor scrubbers, electric motorcycles, electric cars, trucks, vans, and other electric vehicles.


=== Charging ===


==== Grid capacity ====
If almost all road vehicles were electric it would increase global demand for electricity by up to 25% by 2050 compared to 2020",Electric Vehicles
"However, overall energy consumption and emissions would diminish because of the higher efficiency of EVs over the entire cycle, and the reduction in energy needed to refine fossil fuels.


==== Charging stations ====


==== Battery swapping ====
Instead of recharging EVs from electric sockets, batteries could be mechanically replaced at special stations in a few minutes (battery swapping).
Batteries with greater energy density such as metal-air fuel cells cannot always be recharged in a purely electric way, so some form of mechanical recharge may be used instead",Electric Vehicles
"A zinc–air battery, technically a fuel cell, is difficult to recharge electrically so may be ""refueled"" by periodically replacing the anode or electrolyte instead.


==== Dynamic charging ====

TRL (formerly Transport Research Laboratory) lists three power delivery types for dynamic charging, or charging while the vehicle is in motion: overhead power lines, and ground level power through rail or induction",Electric Vehicles
"TRL lists overhead power as the most technologically mature solution which provides the highest levels of power, but the technology is unsuitable for non-commercial vehicles",Electric Vehicles
"Ground-level power is suitable for all vehicles, with rail being a mature solution with high transfer of power and easily accessible and inspected elements",Electric Vehicles
"Inductive charging delivers the least power and requires more roadside equipment than the alternatives.: Appendix D 
The European Commission published in 2021 a request for regulation and standardization of electric road systems",Electric Vehicles
"Shortly afterward, a working group of the French Ministry of Ecology recommended adopting a European electric road standard formulated with Sweden, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Spain, Poland, and others",Electric Vehicles
"The first standard for electrical equipment on-board a vehicle powered by a rail electric road system (ERS), CENELEC Technical Standard 50717, has been approved in late 2022",Electric Vehicles
"Following standards, encompassing ""full interoperability"" and a ""unified and interoperable solution"" for ground-level power supply, are scheduled to be published by the end 2024, detailing complete ""specifications for communication and power supply through conductive rails embedded in the road"".


=== Other in-development technologies ===

Conventional electric double-layer capacitors are being worked on to achieve the energy density of lithium-ion batteries, offering almost unlimited lifespans and no environmental issues",Electric Vehicles
"High-K electric double-layer capacitors, such as EEStor's EESU, could improve lithium ion energy density several times over if they can be produced",Electric Vehicles
"Sodium-ion batteries promise 400 Wh/kg with only minimal expansion/contraction during charge/discharge and a very high surface area, and rely on lower cost materials than Lithium-ion, Leading to Cheaper batteries that do not require critical minerals.


=== Safety ===

The United Nations in Geneva (UNECE) has adopted the first international regulation (Regulation 100) on safety of both fully electric and hybrid electric cars, with the intent of ensuring that cars with a high voltage electric power train, such as hybrid and fully-electric vehicles, are as safe as combustion-powered cars",Electric Vehicles
"The EU and Japan have already indicated that they intend to incorporate the new UNECE Regulation in their respective rules on technical standards for vehicles.


=== Environmental ===

EVs release no tailpipe air pollutants, and reduce respiratory illnesses such as asthma",Electric Vehicles
"However, EVs are charged with electricity that may be generated by means that have health and environmental impacts.
The carbon emissions from producing and operating an EV are in the majority of cases less than those of producing and operating a conventional vehicle",Electric Vehicles
"EVs in urban areas almost always pollute less than internal combustion vehicles.
One limitation of the environmental potential of EVs is that simply switching the existing privately owned car fleet from ICEs to EVs will not free up road space for active travel or public transport",Electric Vehicles
"Electric micromobility vehicles, such as e-bikes, may contribute to the decarbonisation of transport systems, especially outside of urban areas which are already well-served by public transport.
Internal combustion engined vehicles use far more raw materials over their lifetime than EVs.


==== Lithium-ion batteries ====
Since their first commercial release in 1991, lithium-ion batteries have become an important technology for achieving low-carbon transportation systems",Electric Vehicles
" Information regarding the sustainability of production process of batteries has become a politically charged topic.
Business processes of raw material extraction in practice raise issues of transparency and accountability of the management of extractive resources",Electric Vehicles
"In the complex supply chain of lithium technology, there are diverse stakeholders representing corporate interests, public interest groups and political elites that are concerned with outcomes from the technology production and use",Electric Vehicles
"One possibility to achieve balanced extractive processes would be the establishment of commonly agreed standards on the governance of technology worldwide.
The compliance of these standards can be assessed by the Assessment of Sustainability in Supply Chains Frameworks (ASSC)",Electric Vehicles
"Hereby, the qualitative assessment consists of examining governance and social and environmental commitment",Electric Vehicles
"Indicators for the quantitative assessment are management systems and standards, compliance and social and environmental indicators.
One source estimates that over a fifth of the lithium and about 65% of the cobalt needed for electric cars will be from recycled sources by 2035",Electric Vehicles
"On the other hand, when counting the large quantities of fossil fuel non-electric cars consume over their lifetime, electric cars can be considered to dramatically reduce raw-material needs.

In 2022, the manufacturing of an EV emitted on average around 50% more CO2 than an equivalent internal combustion engine vehicle, but this difference is more than offset by the much higher emissions from the oil used in driving an internal combustion engine Vehicle over its lifetime compared to those from generating the electricity used for driving the EV.
In 2023, Greenpeace issued a video criticizing the view that EVs are ""silver bullet for climate"", arguing that the construction phase has a high environmental impact",Electric Vehicles
"For example, the rise in SUV sales by Hyundai almost eliminate the climate benefits of passing to EV in this company, because even electric SUVs have a high carbon footprint as they consume much raw materials and energy during construction",Electric Vehicles
"Greenpeace proposes a mobility as a service concept instead, based on biking, public transport and ride sharing.
Open-pit nickel mining has led to environmental degradation and pollution in developing countries such as the Philippines and Indonesia",Electric Vehicles
"In 2024, nickel mining and processing was one of the main causes of deforestation in Indonesia",Electric Vehicles
Open-pit cobalt mining has led to deforestation and habitat destruction in the Democratic Republic of Congo,Electric Vehicles
"


=== Socio-economic ===
A 2003 study in the United Kingdom found that ""[p]ollution is most concentrated in areas where young children and their parents are more likely to live and least concentrated in areas to which the elderly tend to migrate,"" and that ""those communities that are most polluted and which also emit the least pollution tend to be amongst the poorest in Britain."" A 2019 UK study found that ""households in the poorest areas emit the least NOx and PM, whilst the least poor areas emitted the highest, per km, vehicle emissions per household through having higher vehicle ownership, owning more diesel vehicles and driving further.""


=== Mechanical ===

Electric motors are mechanically very simple and often achieve 90% energy conversion efficiency over the full range of speeds and power output and can be precisely controlled",Electric Vehicles
They can also be combined with regenerative braking systems that have the ability to convert movement energy back into stored electricity,Electric Vehicles
This can be used to reduce the wear on brake systems (and consequent brake pad dust) and reduce the total energy requirement of a trip,Electric Vehicles
"Regenerative braking is especially effective for start-and-stop city use.
They can be finely controlled and provide high torque from stationary-to-moving, unlike internal combustion engines, and do not need multiple gears to match power curves",Electric Vehicles
"This removes the need for gearboxes and torque converters.
EVs provide quiet and smooth operation and consequently have less noise and vibration than internal combustion engines",Electric Vehicles
"While this is a desirable attribute, it has also evoked concern that the absence of the usual sounds of an approaching vehicle poses a danger to blind, elderly and very young pedestrians",Electric Vehicles
"To mitigate this situation, many countries mandate warning sounds when EVs are moving slowly, up to a speed when normal motion and rotation (road, suspension, electric motor, etc.) noises become audible.
Electric motors do not require oxygen, unlike internal combustion engines; this is useful for submarines and for space rovers.


=== Energy resilience ===
Electricity can be produced from a variety of sources; therefore, it gives the greatest degree of energy resilience.


=== Energy efficiency ===
EV 'tank-to-wheels' efficiency is about a factor of three higher than internal combustion engine vehicles",Electric Vehicles
"Energy is not consumed while the vehicle is stationary, unlike internal combustion engines which consume fuel while idling",Electric Vehicles
"In 2022, EVs enabled a net reduction of about 80 Mt of GHG emissions, on a well to-wheels basis, and the net GHG benefit of EVs will increase over time as the electricity sector is decarbonised.
Well-to-wheel efficiency of an EV has less to do with the vehicle itself and more to do with the method of electricity production",Electric Vehicles
"A particular EV would instantly become twice as efficient if electricity production were switched from fossil fuels to renewable energy, such as wind power, tidal power, solar power, and nuclear power",Electric Vehicles
"Thus, when ""well-to-wheels"" is cited, the discussion is no longer about the vehicle, but rather about the entire energy supply infrastructure – in the case of fossil fuels this should also include energy spent on exploration, mining, refining, and distribution.
The lifecycle analysis of EVs shows that even when powered by the most carbon-intensive electricity in Europe, they emit less greenhouse gases than a conventional diesel vehicle.


=== Total cost ===
As of 2021 the purchase price of an EV is often more, but the total cost of ownership of an EV varies wildly depending on location and distance travelled per year: in parts of the world where fossil fuels are subsidized, lifecycle costs of diesel or gas-powered vehicle are sometimes less than a comparable EV.
European carmakers face significant pressure from more affordable Chinese models and price cuts by US-based Tesla Motor",Electric Vehicles
"From 2021 to 2022, the European market share of Chinese EV manufacturers doubled to almost 9%, prompting the CEO of Stellantis to describe it as an ""invasion"".


=== Range ===

Electric vehicles may have shorter range compared to vehicles with internal combustion engines, which is why the electrification of long-distance transport, such as long-distance shipping, remains challenging.
In 2022, the sales-weighted average range of small BEVs sold in the United States was nearly 350 km, while in France, Germany and the United Kingdom it was just under 300 km, compared to under 220 km in China.


=== Heating of EVs ===
Well insulated cabins can heat the vehicle using the body heat of the passengers",Electric Vehicles
"This is not enough, however, in colder climates as a driver delivers only about 100 W of heating power",Electric Vehicles
"A heat pump system, capable of cooling the cabin during summer and heating it during winter, is an efficient way of heating and cooling EVs",Electric Vehicles
"For vehicles which are connected to the grid, battery EVs can be preheated, or cooled, with little or no need for battery energy, especially for short trips",Electric Vehicles
"Most new electric cars come with heat pumps as standard.


== Electric public transit efficiency ==

Shifts from private to public transport (train, trolleybus, personal rapid transit or tram) have the potential for large gains in efficiency in terms of an individual's distance traveled per kWh.
Research shows people prefer trams to buses, because they are quieter and more comfortable and perceived as having higher status",Electric Vehicles
"Therefore, it may be possible to cut liquid fossil fuel consumption in cities through the use of electric trams",Electric Vehicles
"Trams may be the most energy-efficient form of public transportation, with rubber-wheeled vehicles using two-thirds more energy than the equivalent tram, and run on electricity rather than fossil fuels.
In terms of net present value, they are also the cheapest – Blackpool trams are still running after 100 years, but combustion buses only last about 15 years.


== Accident rate ==
Research published in the British Medical Journal indicates that electric cars hit pedestrians at twice the rate of petrol or diesel vehicles due to being quieter.


== Government incentivization ==

The IEA suggests that taxing inefficient internal combustion engine vehicles could encourage adoption of EVs, with taxes raised being used to fund subsidies for EVs",Electric Vehicles
Government procurement is sometimes used to encourage national EV manufacturers,Electric Vehicles
"Many countries will ban sales of fossil fuel vehicles between 2025 and 2040.
Many governments offer incentives to promote the use of electric vehicles, with the goals of reducing air pollution and oil consumption",Electric Vehicles
Some incentives intend to increase purchases of electric vehicles by offsetting the purchase price with a grant,Electric Vehicles
"Other incentives include lower tax rates or exemption from certain taxes, and investment in charging infrastructure.
Companies selling EVs have partnered with local electric utilities to provide large incentives on some electric vehicles.


== Future ==


=== Public perception ===
A European survey based on climate found that as of 2022, 39% of European citizens tend to prefer hybrid vehicles, 33% prefer petrol or diesel vehicles, followed by electric cars which were preferred by 28% of Europeans",Electric Vehicles
"44% Chinese car buyers are the most likely to buy an electric car, while 38% of Americans would opt for a hybrid car, 33% would prefer petrol or diesel, while only 29% would go for an electric car.
In a 2023 survey concentrated specifically on electric car ownership in the US, 50% of respondents planning to purchase a future car considered themselves unlikely to seriously consider buying an EV",Electric Vehicles
The survey also found that support for banning the production of non-electric vehicles in the US by 2035 has declined from 47% to 40%,Electric Vehicles
"


=== Environmental considerations ===

By reducing types of air pollution, such as nitrogen dioxide, EVs could prevent hundreds of thousands of early deaths every year, especially from trucks and traffic in cities.
The full environmental impact of electric vehicles includes the life cycle impacts of carbon and sulfur emissions, as well as toxic metals entering the environment.
Rare-earth metals (neodymium, dysprosium) and other mined metals (copper, nickel, iron) are used by EV motors, while lithium, cobalt, manganese are used by the batteries",Electric Vehicles
In 2023 the US State Department said that the supply of lithium would need to increase 42-fold by 2050 globally to support a transition to clean energy,Electric Vehicles
"Most of the lithium-ion battery production occurs in China, where the bulk of energy used is supplied by coal burning power plants",Electric Vehicles
A study of hundreds of cars on sale in 2021 concluded that the life cycle GHG emissions of full electric cars are slightly less than hybrids and that both are less than gasoline and diesel fuelled cars,Electric Vehicles
"
An alternative method of sourcing essential battery materials being deliberated by the International Seabed Authority is deep sea mining, however carmakers are not using this as of 2023.


=== Improved batteries ===
Advances in lithium-ion batteries, driven at first by the personal-use electronics industry, allow full-sized, highway-capable EVs to travel nearly as far on a single charge as conventional cars go on a single tank of gasoline",Electric Vehicles
"Lithium batteries have been made safe, can be recharged in minutes instead of hours (see recharging time), and now last longer than the typical vehicle (see lifespan)",Electric Vehicles
"The production cost of these lighter, higher-capacity lithium-ion batteries is gradually decreasing as the technology matures and production volumes increase",Electric Vehicles
"Research is also underway to improve battery reuse and recycling, which would further reduce the environmental impact of batteries.

Many companies and researchers are also working on newer battery technologies, including solid state batteries and alternate technologies.


=== Battery management and intermediate storage ===
Another improvement is to decouple the electric motor from the battery through electronic control, using supercapacitors to buffer large but short power demands and regenerative braking energy",Electric Vehicles
The development of new cell types combined with intelligent cell management improved both weak points mentioned above,Electric Vehicles
The cell management involves not only monitoring the health of the cells but also a redundant cell configuration (one more cell than needed),Electric Vehicles
"With sophisticated switched wiring, it is possible to condition one cell while the rest are on duty.


=== Electric trucks ===


=== Hydrogen trains ===
Particularly in Europe, fuel-cell electric trains are gaining in popularity to replace diesel-electric units",Electric Vehicles
"In Germany, several Länder have ordered Alstom Coradia iLINT trainsets, in service since 2018, with France also planning to order trainsets",Electric Vehicles
"The United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Italy, Canada and Mexico are equally interested",Electric Vehicles
"In France, the SNCF plans to replace all its remaining diesel-electric trains with hydrogen trains by 2035",Electric Vehicles
"In the United Kingdom, Alstom announced in 2018 their plan to retrofit British Rail Class 321 trainsets with fuel cells.


=== Higher voltage outlets in garages of newly built homes ===

In New Mexico the government is looking to pass legislation mandating electrical receptacles that are higher voltage to be installed in garages of newly built homes",Electric Vehicles
 The NEMA 14-50 outlets provide 240 volts and 50 Amps for a total of 12.5 Kilowatts for level 2 charging of electric vehicles,Electric Vehicles
"Level 2 charging can add up to 30 miles of range per hour of charging compared to up to 4 miles of range per hour for level 1 charging from 120 volt outlets.


=== Bidirectional charging ===
General Motors (GM) is adding a capability called V2H, or bidirectional charging, to allow its new electric vehicles to send power from their batteries to the owner's home",Electric Vehicles
" GM will start with 2024 models, including the Silverado and Blazer EVs, and promises to continue the feature through to model year 2026",Electric Vehicles
" This could be helpful to the owner during unexpected power grid outages because an electric vehicle is a giant battery on wheels.


== Infrastructure management ==
With the increase in number of electric vehicles, it is necessary to create an appropriate number of charging stations to supply the increasing demand, and a proper management system that coordinates the charging turn of each vehicle to avoid having some charging stations overloaded with vehicles and others empty.


=== Stabilization of the grid ===

Since EVs can be plugged into the electric grid when not in use, battery-powered vehicles could reduce the need for dispatchable generation by feeding electricity into the grid from their batteries during periods of high demand and low supply (such as just after sunset) while doing most of their charging at night or midday, when there is unused generating capacity",Electric Vehicles
"This vehicle-to-grid (V2G) connection has the potential to reduce the need for new power plants, as long as vehicle owners do not mind reducing the life of their batteries, by being drained by the power company during peak demand",Electric Vehicles
"Electric vehicle parking lots can provide demand response.
Current electricity infrastructure may need to cope with increasing shares of variable-output power sources such as wind and solar",Electric Vehicles
"This variability could be addressed by adjusting the speed at which EV batteries are charged, or possibly even discharged.
Some concepts see battery exchanges and battery charging stations, much like gas/petrol stations today",Electric Vehicles
"These will require enormous storage and charging potentials, which could be manipulated to vary the rate of charging, and to output power during shortage periods, much as diesel generators are used for short periods to stabilize some national grids.


=== Repair shops ===
The infrastructure for vehicle repairs after accidents is a concern for insurers and mechanics due to safety requirements",Electric Vehicles
"Batteries and other components must be carefully evaluated rather than being totally written off by insurers.

Natural language processing (NLP) is an interdisciplinary subfield of computer science and artificial intelligence,Natural Language Processing
"It is primarily concerned with providing computers with the ability to process data encoded in natural language and is thus closely related to information retrieval, knowledge representation and computational linguistics, a subfield of linguistics",Natural Language Processing
"Typically data is collected in text corpora, using either rule-based, statistical or neural-based approaches in machine learning and deep learning.
Major tasks in natural language processing are speech recognition, text classification, natural-language understanding, and natural-language generation.


== History ==

Natural language processing has its roots in the 1950s",Natural Language Processing
"Already in 1950, Alan Turing published an article titled ""Computing Machinery and Intelligence"" which proposed what is now called the Turing test as a criterion of intelligence, though at the time that was not articulated as a problem separate from artificial intelligence",Natural Language Processing
"The proposed test includes a task that involves the automated interpretation and generation of natural language.


=== Symbolic NLP (1950s – early 1990s) ===
The premise of symbolic NLP is well-summarized by John Searle's Chinese room experiment: Given a collection of rules (e.g., a Chinese phrasebook, with questions and matching answers), the computer emulates natural language understanding (or other NLP tasks) by applying those rules to the data it confronts.

1950s: The Georgetown experiment in 1954 involved fully automatic translation of more than sixty Russian sentences into English",Natural Language Processing
"The authors claimed that within three or five years, machine translation would be a solved problem",Natural Language Processing
" However, real progress was much slower, and after the ALPAC report in 1966, which found that ten years of research had failed to fulfill the expectations, funding for machine translation was dramatically reduced",Natural Language Processing
"Little further research in machine translation was conducted in America (though some research continued elsewhere, such as Japan and Europe) until the late 1980s when the first statistical machine translation systems were developed.
1960s: Some notably successful natural language processing systems developed in the 1960s were SHRDLU, a natural language system working in restricted ""blocks worlds"" with restricted vocabularies, and ELIZA, a simulation of a Rogerian psychotherapist, written by Joseph Weizenbaum between 1964 and 1966",Natural Language Processing
"Using almost no information about human thought or emotion, ELIZA sometimes provided a startlingly human-like interaction",Natural Language Processing
"When the ""patient"" exceeded the very small knowledge base, ELIZA might provide a generic response, for example, responding to ""My head hurts"" with ""Why do you say your head hurts?""",Natural Language Processing
"Ross Quillian's successful work on natural language was demonstrated with a vocabulary of only twenty words, because that was all that would fit in a computer  memory at the time.
1970s: During the 1970s, many programmers began to write ""conceptual ontologies"", which structured real-world information into computer-understandable data",Natural Language Processing
" Examples are MARGIE (Schank, 1975), SAM (Cullingford, 1978), PAM (Wilensky, 1978), TaleSpin (Meehan, 1976), QUALM (Lehnert, 1977), Politics (Carbonell, 1979), and Plot Units (Lehnert 1981)",Natural Language Processing
" During this time, the first chatterbots were written (e.g., PARRY).
1980s: The 1980s and early 1990s mark the heyday of symbolic methods in NLP",Natural Language Processing
"Focus areas of the time included research on rule-based parsing (e.g., the development of HPSG as a computational operationalization of generative grammar), morphology (e.g., two-level morphology), semantics (e.g., Lesk algorithm), reference (e.g., within Centering Theory) and other areas of natural language understanding (e.g., in the Rhetorical Structure Theory)",Natural Language Processing
"Other lines of research were continued, e.g., the development of chatterbots with Racter and Jabberwacky",Natural Language Processing
"An important development (that eventually led to the statistical turn in the 1990s) was the rising importance of quantitative evaluation in this period.


=== Statistical NLP (1990s–2010s) ===
Up until the 1980s, most natural language processing systems were based on complex sets of hand-written rules",Natural Language Processing
" Starting in the late 1980s, however, there was a revolution in natural language processing with the introduction of machine learning algorithms for language processing",Natural Language Processing
 This was due to both the steady increase in computational power (see Moore's law) and the gradual lessening of the dominance of Chomskyan theories of linguistics (e.g,Natural Language Processing
"transformational grammar), whose theoretical underpinnings discouraged the sort of corpus linguistics that underlies the machine-learning approach to language processing",Natural Language Processing
"

1990s: Many of the notable early successes in statistical methods in NLP occurred in the field of machine translation, due especially to work at IBM Research, such as IBM alignment models",Natural Language Processing
 These systems were able to take advantage of existing multilingual textual corpora that had been produced by the Parliament of Canada and the European Union as a result of laws calling for the translation of all governmental proceedings into all official languages of the corresponding systems of government,Natural Language Processing
" However, most other systems depended on corpora specifically developed for the tasks implemented by these systems, which was (and often continues to be) a major limitation in the success of these systems",Natural Language Processing
"As a result, a great deal of research has gone into methods of more effectively learning from limited amounts of data.
2000s: With the growth of the web, increasing amounts of raw (unannotated) language data have become available since the mid-1990s",Natural Language Processing
Research has thus increasingly focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised learning algorithms,Natural Language Processing
 Such algorithms can learn from data that has not been hand-annotated with the desired answers or using a combination of annotated and non-annotated data,Natural Language Processing
" Generally, this task is much more difficult than supervised learning, and typically produces less accurate results for a given amount of input data",Natural Language Processing
" However, there is an enormous amount of non-annotated data available (including, among other things, the entire content of the World Wide Web), which can often make up for the inferior results if the algorithm used has a low enough time complexity to be practical.


=== Neural NLP (present) ===
In 2003, word n-gram model, at the time the best statistical algorithm, was outperformed by a multi-layer perceptron (with a single hidden layer and context length of several words trained on up to 14 million of words with a CPU cluster in language modelling) by Yoshua Bengio with co-authors",Natural Language Processing
"
In 2010, Tomáš Mikolov (then a PhD student at Brno University of Technology) with co-authors applied a simple recurrent neural network with a single hidden layer to language modelling, and in the following years he went on to develop Word2vec",Natural Language Processing
"In the 2010s, representation learning and deep neural network-style (featuring many hidden layers) machine learning methods became widespread in natural language processing",Natural Language Processing
"That popularity was due partly to a flurry of results showing that such techniques can achieve state-of-the-art results in many natural language tasks, e.g., in language modeling and parsing",Natural Language Processing
"This is increasingly important in medicine and healthcare, where NLP helps analyze notes and text in electronic health records that would otherwise be inaccessible for study when seeking to improve care or protect patient privacy.


== Approaches: Symbolic, statistical, neural networks ==
Symbolic approach, i.e., the hand-coding of a set of rules for manipulating symbols, coupled with a dictionary lookup, was historically the first approach used both by AI in general and by NLP in particular: such as by writing grammars or devising heuristic rules for stemming.
Machine learning approaches, which include both statistical and neural networks, on the other hand, have many advantages over the symbolic approach: 

both statistical and neural networks methods can focus more on the most common cases extracted from a corpus of texts, whereas the rule-based approach needs to provide rules for both rare cases and common ones equally.
language models, produced by either statistical or neural networks methods, are more robust to both unfamiliar (e.g",Natural Language Processing
containing words or structures that have not been seen before) and erroneous input (e.g,Natural Language Processing
"with misspelled words or words accidentally omitted) in comparison to the rule-based systems, which are also more costly to produce.
the larger such a (probabilistic) language model is, the more accurate it becomes, in contrast to rule-based systems that can gain accuracy only by increasing the amount and complexity of the rules leading to intractability problems.
Although rule-based systems for manipulating symbols were still in use in 2020, they have become mostly obsolete with the advance of LLMs in 2023",Natural Language Processing
"
Before that they were commonly used:

when the amount of training data is insufficient to successfully apply machine learning methods, e.g., for the machine translation of low-resource languages such as provided by the Apertium system,
for preprocessing in NLP pipelines, e.g., tokenization, or
for postprocessing and transforming the output of NLP pipelines, e.g., for knowledge extraction from syntactic parses.


=== Statistical approach ===
In the late 1980s and mid-1990s, the statistical approach ended a period of AI winter, which was caused by the inefficiencies of the rule-based approaches.
The earliest decision trees, producing systems of hard if–then rules, were still very similar to the old rule-based approaches.
Only the introduction of hidden Markov models, applied to part-of-speech tagging, announced the end of the old rule-based approach.


=== Neural networks ===

A major drawback of statistical methods is that they require elaborate feature engineering",Natural Language Processing
"Since 2015, the statistical approach has been replaced by the neural networks approach, using semantic networks and word embeddings to capture semantic properties of words",Natural Language Processing
" 
Intermediate tasks (e.g., part-of-speech tagging and dependency parsing) are not needed anymore",Natural Language Processing
"
Neural machine translation, based on then-newly-invented sequence-to-sequence transformations, made obsolete the intermediate steps, such as word alignment, previously necessary for statistical machine translation.


== Common NLP tasks ==
The following is a list of some of the most commonly researched tasks in natural language processing",Natural Language Processing
"Some of these tasks have direct real-world applications, while others more commonly serve as subtasks that are used to aid in solving larger tasks.
Though natural language processing tasks are closely intertwined, they can be subdivided into categories for convenience",Natural Language Processing
"A coarse division is given below.


=== Text and speech processing ===
Optical character recognition (OCR)
Given an image representing printed text, determine the corresponding text.
Speech recognition
Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, determine the textual representation of the speech",Natural Language Processing
" This is the opposite of text to speech and is one of the extremely difficult problems colloquially termed ""AI-complete"" (see above)",Natural Language Processing
" In natural speech there are hardly any pauses between successive words, and thus speech segmentation is a necessary subtask of speech recognition (see below)",Natural Language Processing
"In most spoken languages, the sounds representing successive letters blend into each other in a process termed coarticulation, so the conversion of the analog signal to discrete characters can be a very difficult process",Natural Language Processing
"Also, given that words in the same language are spoken by people with different accents, the speech recognition software must be able to recognize the wide variety of input as being identical to each other in terms of its textual equivalent.
Speech segmentation
Given a sound clip of a person or people speaking, separate it into words",Natural Language Processing
" A subtask of speech recognition and typically grouped with it.
Text-to-speech
Given a text, transform those units and produce a spoken representation",Natural Language Processing
"Text-to-speech can be used to aid the visually impaired.
Word segmentation (Tokenization)
Tokenization is a process used in text analysis that divides text into individual words or word fragments",Natural Language Processing
This technique results in two key components: a word index and tokenized text,Natural Language Processing
"The word index is a list that maps unique words to specific numerical identifiers, and the tokenized text replaces each word with its corresponding numerical token",Natural Language Processing
"These numerical tokens are then used in various deep learning methods.
For a language like English, this is fairly trivial, since words are usually separated by spaces",Natural Language Processing
"However, some written languages like Chinese, Japanese and Thai do not mark word boundaries in such a fashion, and in those languages text segmentation is a significant task requiring knowledge of the vocabulary and morphology of words in the language",Natural Language Processing
"Sometimes this process is also used in cases like bag of words (BOW) creation in data mining.


=== Morphological analysis ===
Lemmatization
The task of removing inflectional endings only and to return the base dictionary form of a word which is also known as a lemma",Natural Language Processing
Lemmatization is another technique for reducing words to their normalized form,Natural Language Processing
"But in this case, the transformation actually uses a dictionary to map words to their actual form.
Morphological segmentation
Separate words into individual morphemes and identify the class of the morphemes",Natural Language Processing
"The difficulty of this task depends greatly on the complexity of the morphology (i.e., the structure of words) of the language being considered",Natural Language Processing
"English has fairly simple morphology, especially inflectional morphology, and thus it is often possible to ignore this task entirely and simply model all possible forms of a word (e.g., ""open, opens, opened, opening"") as separate words",Natural Language Processing
"In languages such as Turkish or Meitei, a highly agglutinated Indian language, however, such an approach is not possible, as each dictionary entry has thousands of possible word forms.
Part-of-speech tagging
Given a sentence, determine the part of speech (POS) for each word",Natural Language Processing
"Many words, especially common ones, can serve as multiple parts of speech",Natural Language Processing
"For example, ""book"" can be a noun (""the book on the table"") or verb (""to book a flight""); ""set"" can be a noun, verb or adjective; and ""out"" can be any of at least five different parts of speech.
Stemming
The process of reducing inflected (or sometimes derived) words to a base form (e.g., ""close"" will be the root for ""closed"", ""closing"", ""close"", ""closer"" etc.)",Natural Language Processing
"Stemming yields similar results as lemmatization, but does so on grounds of rules, not a dictionary.


=== Syntactic analysis ===

Grammar induction
Generate a formal grammar that describes a language's syntax.
Sentence breaking (also known as ""sentence boundary disambiguation"")
Given a chunk of text, find the sentence boundaries",Natural Language Processing
"Sentence boundaries are often marked by periods or other punctuation marks, but these same characters can serve other purposes (e.g., marking abbreviations).
Parsing
Determine the parse tree (grammatical analysis) of a given sentence",Natural Language Processing
"The grammar for natural languages is ambiguous and typical sentences have multiple possible analyses: perhaps surprisingly, for a typical sentence there may be thousands of potential parses (most of which will seem completely nonsensical to a human)",Natural Language Processing
There are two primary types of parsing: dependency parsing and constituency parsing,Natural Language Processing
"Dependency parsing focuses on the relationships between words in a sentence (marking things like primary objects and predicates), whereas constituency parsing focuses on building out the parse tree using a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG) (see also stochastic grammar).


=== Lexical semantics (of individual words in context) ===
Lexical semantics
What is the computational meaning of individual words in context?
Distributional semantics
How can we learn semantic representations from data?
Named entity recognition (NER)
Given a stream of text, determine which items in the text map to proper names, such as people or places, and what the type of each such name is (e.g",Natural Language Processing
"Although capitalization can aid in recognizing named entities in languages such as English, this information cannot aid in determining the type of named entity, and in any case, is often inaccurate or insufficient",Natural Language Processing
" For example, the first letter of a sentence is also capitalized, and named entities often span several words, only some of which are capitalized",Natural Language Processing
"Chinese or Arabic) do not have any capitalization at all, and even languages with capitalization may not consistently use it to distinguish names",Natural Language Processing
"For example, German capitalizes all nouns, regardless of whether they are names, and French and Spanish do not capitalize names that serve as adjectives",Natural Language Processing
"Another name for this task is token classification.
Sentiment analysis (see also Multimodal sentiment analysis)
Sentiment analysis is a computational method used to identify and classify the emotional intent behind text",Natural Language Processing
"This technique involves analyzing text to determine whether the expressed sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral",Natural Language Processing
"Models for sentiment classification typically utilize inputs such as word n-grams, Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) features, hand-generated features, or employ deep learning models designed to recognize both long-term and short-term dependencies in text sequences",Natural Language Processing
"The applications of sentiment analysis are diverse, extending to tasks such as categorizing customer reviews on various online platforms.
Terminology extraction
The goal of terminology extraction is to automatically extract relevant terms from a given corpus.
Word-sense disambiguation (WSD)
Many words have more than one meaning; we have to select the meaning which makes the most sense in context",Natural Language Processing
" For this problem, we are typically given a list of words and associated word senses, e.g",Natural Language Processing
"from a dictionary or an online resource such as WordNet.
Entity linking
Many words—typically proper names—refer to named entities; here we have to select the entity (a famous individual, a location, a company, etc.) which is referred to in context.


=== Relational semantics (semantics of individual sentences) ===
Relationship extraction
Given a chunk of text, identify the relationships among named entities (e.g",Natural Language Processing
"who is married to whom).
Semantic parsing
Given a piece of text (typically a sentence), produce a formal representation of its semantics, either as a graph (e.g., in AMR parsing) or in accordance with a logical formalism (e.g., in DRT parsing)",Natural Language Processing
"This challenge typically includes aspects of several more elementary NLP tasks from semantics (e.g., semantic role labelling, word-sense disambiguation) and can be extended to include full-fledged discourse analysis (e.g., discourse analysis, coreference; see Natural language understanding below).
Semantic role labelling (see also implicit semantic role labelling below)
Given a single sentence, identify and disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames), then identify and classify the frame elements (semantic roles).


=== Discourse (semantics beyond individual sentences) ===
Coreference resolution
Given a sentence or larger chunk of text, determine which words (""mentions"") refer to the same objects (""entities"")",Natural Language Processing
"Anaphora resolution is a specific example of this task, and is specifically concerned with matching up pronouns with the nouns or names to which they refer",Natural Language Processing
"The more general task of coreference resolution also includes identifying so-called ""bridging relationships"" involving referring expressions",Natural Language Processing
"For example, in a sentence such as ""He entered John's house through the front door"", ""the front door"" is a referring expression and the bridging relationship to be identified is the fact that the door being referred to is the front door of John's house (rather than of some other structure that might also be referred to).
Discourse analysis
This rubric includes several related tasks",Natural Language Processing
" One task is discourse parsing, i.e., identifying the discourse structure of a connected text, i.e",Natural Language Processing
 Another possible task is recognizing and classifying the speech acts in a chunk of text (e.g,Natural Language Processing
"yes–no question, content question, statement, assertion, etc.).
Implicit semantic role labelling
Given a single sentence, identify and disambiguate semantic predicates (e.g., verbal frames) and their explicit semantic roles in the current sentence (see Semantic role labelling above)",Natural Language Processing
"Then, identify semantic roles that are not explicitly realized in the current sentence, classify them into arguments that are explicitly realized elsewhere in the text and those that are not specified, and resolve the former against the local text",Natural Language Processing
"A closely related task is zero anaphora resolution, i.e., the extension of coreference resolution to pro-drop languages.
Recognizing textual entailment
Given two text fragments, determine if one being true entails the other, entails the other's negation, or allows the other to be either true or false.
Topic segmentation and recognition
Given a chunk of text, separate it into segments each of which is devoted to a topic, and identify the topic of the segment.
Argument mining
The goal of argument mining is the automatic extraction and identification of argumentative structures from natural language text with the aid of computer programs",Natural Language Processing
"Such argumentative structures include the premise, conclusions, the argument scheme and the relationship between the main and subsidiary argument, or the main and counter-argument within discourse.


=== Higher-level NLP applications ===
Automatic summarization (text summarization)
Produce a readable summary of a chunk of text",Natural Language Processing
" Often used to provide summaries of the text of a known type, such as research papers, articles in the financial section of a newspaper.
Grammatical error correction
Grammatical error detection and correction involves a great band-width of problems on all levels of linguistic analysis (phonology/orthography, morphology, syntax, semantics, pragmatics)",Natural Language Processing
Grammatical error correction is impactful since it affects hundreds of millions of people that use or acquire English as a second language,Natural Language Processing
It has thus been subject to a number of shared tasks since 2011,Natural Language Processing
"As far as orthography, morphology, syntax and certain aspects of semantics are concerned, and due to the development of powerful neural language models such as GPT-2, this can now (2019) be considered a largely solved problem and is being marketed in various commercial applications.
Logic translation
Translate a text from a natural language into formal logic.
Machine translation (MT)
Automatically translate text from one human language to another",Natural Language Processing
" This is one of the most difficult problems, and is a member of a class of problems colloquially termed ""AI-complete"", i.e",Natural Language Processing
"requiring all of the different types of knowledge that humans possess (grammar, semantics, facts about the real world, etc.) to solve properly.
Natural-language understanding (NLU)
Convert chunks of text into more formal representations such as first-order logic structures that are easier for computer programs to manipulate",Natural Language Processing
Natural language understanding involves the identification of the intended semantic from the multiple possible semantics which can be derived from a natural language expression which usually takes the form of organized notations of natural language concepts,Natural Language Processing
Introduction and creation of language metamodel and ontology are efficient however empirical solutions,Natural Language Processing
An explicit formalization of natural language semantics without confusions with implicit assumptions such as closed-world assumption (CWA) vs,Natural Language Processing
"objective True/False is expected for the construction of a basis of semantics formalization.
Natural-language generation (NLG):
Convert information from computer databases or semantic intents into readable human language.
Book generation
Not an NLP task proper but an extension of natural language generation and other NLP tasks is the creation of full-fledged books",Natural Language Processing
"The first machine-generated book was created by a rule-based system in 1984 (Racter, The policeman's beard is half-constructed)",Natural Language Processing
"The first published work by a neural network was published in 2018, 1 the Road, marketed as a novel, contains sixty million words",Natural Language Processing
Both these systems are basically elaborate but non-sensical (semantics-free) language models,Natural Language Processing
"The first machine-generated science book was published in 2019 (Beta Writer, Lithium-Ion Batteries, Springer, Cham)",Natural Language Processing
"Unlike Racter and 1 the Road, this is grounded on factual knowledge and based on text summarization.
Document AI
A Document AI platform sits on top of the NLP technology enabling users with no prior experience of artificial intelligence, machine learning or NLP to quickly train a computer to extract the specific data they need from different document types",Natural Language Processing
"NLP-powered Document AI enables non-technical teams to quickly access information hidden in documents, for example, lawyers, business analysts and accountants.
Dialogue management
Computer systems intended to converse with a human.
Question answering
Given a human-language question, determine its answer",Natural Language Processing
"Typical questions have a specific right answer (such as ""What is the capital of Canada?""), but sometimes open-ended questions are also considered (such as ""What is the meaning of life?"").
Text-to-image generation
Given a description of an image, generate an image that matches the description.
Text-to-scene generation
Given a description of a scene, generate a 3D model of the scene.
Text-to-video
Given a description of a video, generate a video that matches the description.


== General tendencies and (possible) future directions ==
Based on long-standing trends in the field, it is possible to extrapolate future directions of NLP",Natural Language Processing
"As of 2020, three trends among the topics of the long-standing series of CoNLL Shared Tasks can be observed:

Interest on increasingly abstract, ""cognitive"" aspects of natural language (1999–2001: shallow parsing, 2002–03: named entity recognition, 2006–09/2017–18: dependency syntax, 2004–05/2008–09 semantic role labelling, 2011–12 coreference, 2015–16: discourse parsing, 2019: semantic parsing).
Increasing interest in multilinguality, and, potentially, multimodality (English since 1999; Spanish, Dutch since 2002; German since 2003; Bulgarian, Danish, Japanese, Portuguese, Slovenian, Swedish, Turkish since 2006; Basque, Catalan, Chinese, Greek, Hungarian, Italian, Turkish since 2007; Czech since 2009; Arabic since 2012; 2017: 40+ languages; 2018: 60+/100+ languages)
Elimination of symbolic representations (rule-based over supervised towards weakly supervised methods, representation learning and end-to-end systems)


=== Cognition ===
Most higher-level NLP applications involve aspects that emulate intelligent behaviour and apparent comprehension of natural language",Natural Language Processing
"More broadly speaking, the technical operationalization of increasingly advanced aspects of cognitive behaviour represents one of the developmental trajectories of NLP (see trends among CoNLL shared tasks above).
Cognition refers to ""the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through thought, experience, and the senses."" Cognitive science is the interdisciplinary, scientific study of the mind and its processes",Natural Language Processing
"Cognitive linguistics is an interdisciplinary branch of linguistics, combining knowledge and research from both psychology and linguistics",Natural Language Processing
"Especially during the age of symbolic NLP, the area of computational linguistics maintained strong ties with cognitive studies.
As an example, George Lakoff offers a methodology to build natural language processing (NLP) algorithms through the perspective of cognitive science, along with the findings of cognitive linguistics, with two defining aspects:

Apply the theory of conceptual metaphor, explained by Lakoff as ""the understanding of one idea, in terms of another"" which provides an idea of the intent of the author",Natural Language Processing
"When used in a comparison (""That is a big tree""), the author's intent is to imply that the tree is physically large relative to other trees or the authors experience",Natural Language Processing
" When used metaphorically (""Tomorrow is a big day""), the author's intent to imply importance",Natural Language Processing
" The intent behind other usages, like in ""She is a big person"", will remain somewhat ambiguous to a person and a cognitive NLP algorithm alike without additional information.
Assign relative measures of meaning to a word, phrase, sentence or piece of text based on the information presented before and after the piece of text being analyzed, e.g., by means of a probabilistic context-free grammar (PCFG)",Natural Language Processing

Ties with cognitive linguistics are part of the historical heritage of NLP, but they have been less frequently addressed since the statistical turn during the 1990s",Natural Language Processing
"Nevertheless, approaches to develop cognitive models towards technically operationalizable frameworks have been pursued in the context of various frameworks, e.g., of cognitive grammar, functional grammar, construction grammar, computational psycholinguistics and cognitive neuroscience (e.g., ACT-R), however, with limited uptake in mainstream NLP (as measured by presence on major conferences of the ACL)",Natural Language Processing
"More recently, ideas of cognitive NLP have been revived as an approach to achieve explainability, e.g., under the notion of ""cognitive AI""",Natural Language Processing
"Likewise, ideas of cognitive NLP are inherent to neural models multimodal NLP (although rarely made explicit) and developments in artificial intelligence, specifically tools and technologies using large language model approaches and new directions in artificial general intelligence based on the free energy principle by British neuroscientist and theoretician at University College London Karl J",Natural Language Processing

== History ==
In the late 1960s, computer vision began at universities that were pioneering artificial intelligence",Computer Vision
It was meant to mimic the human visual system as a stepping stone to endowing robots with intelligent behavior,Computer Vision
"In 1966, it was believed that this could be achieved through an undergraduate summer project, by attaching a camera to a computer and having it ""describe what it saw"".
What distinguished computer vision from the prevalent field of digital image processing at that time was a desire to extract three-dimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding",Computer Vision
"Studies in the 1970s formed the early foundations for many of the computer vision algorithms that exist today, including extraction of edges from images, labeling of lines, non-polyhedral and polyhedral modeling, representation of objects as interconnections of smaller structures, optical flow, and motion estimation.
The next decade saw studies based on more rigorous mathematical analysis and quantitative aspects of computer vision",Computer Vision
"These include the concept of scale-space, the inference of shape from various cues such as shading, texture and focus, and contour models known as snakes",Computer Vision
"Researchers also realized that many of these mathematical concepts could be treated within the same optimization framework as regularization and Markov random fields.
By the 1990s, some of the previous research topics became more active than others",Computer Vision
Research in projective 3-D reconstructions led to better understanding of camera calibration,Computer Vision
"With the advent of optimization methods for camera calibration, it was realized that a lot of the ideas were already explored in bundle adjustment theory from the field of photogrammetry",Computer Vision
This led to methods for sparse 3-D reconstructions of scenes from multiple images,Computer Vision
Progress was made on the dense stereo correspondence problem and further multi-view stereo techniques,Computer Vision
"At the same time, variations of graph cut were used to solve image segmentation",Computer Vision
This decade also marked the first time statistical learning techniques were used in practice to recognize faces in images (see Eigenface),Computer Vision
"Toward the end of the 1990s, a significant change came about with the increased interaction between the fields of computer graphics and computer vision",Computer Vision
"This included image-based rendering, image morphing, view interpolation, panoramic image stitching and early light-field rendering.
Recent work has seen the resurgence of feature-based methods used in conjunction with machine learning techniques and complex optimization frameworks",Computer Vision
"
The advancement of Deep Learning techniques has brought further life to the field of computer vision",Computer Vision
"The accuracy of deep learning algorithms on several benchmark computer vision data sets for tasks ranging from classification, segmentation and optical flow has surpassed prior methods",Computer Vision
"


== Related fields ==


=== Solid-state physics ===
Solid-state physics is another field that is closely related to computer vision",Computer Vision
"Most computer vision systems rely on image sensors, which detect electromagnetic radiation, which is typically in the form of either visible, infrared or ultraviolet light",Computer Vision
The process by which light interacts with surfaces is explained using physics,Computer Vision
Physics explains the behavior of optics which are a core part of most imaging systems,Computer Vision
Sophisticated image sensors even require quantum mechanics to provide a complete understanding of the image formation process,Computer Vision
"Also, various measurement problems in physics can be addressed using computer vision, for example, motion in fluids.


=== Neurobiology ===

Neurobiology has greatly influenced the development of computer vision algorithms",Computer Vision
"Over the last century, there has been an extensive study of eyes, neurons, and brain structures devoted to the processing of visual stimuli in both humans and various animals",Computer Vision
This has led to a coarse yet convoluted description of how natural vision systems operate in order to solve certain vision-related tasks,Computer Vision
These results have led to a sub-field within computer vision where artificial systems are designed to mimic the processing and behavior of biological systems at different levels of complexity,Computer Vision
"Also, some of the learning-based methods developed within computer vision (e.g",Computer Vision
neural net and deep learning based image and feature analysis and classification) have their background in neurobiology,Computer Vision
" The Neocognitron, a neural network developed in the 1970s by Kunihiko Fukushima, is an early example of computer vision taking direct inspiration from neurobiology, specifically the primary visual cortex.
Some strands of computer vision research are closely related to the study of biological vision—indeed, just as many strands of AI research are closely tied with research into human intelligence and the use of stored knowledge to interpret, integrate, and utilize visual information",Computer Vision
The field of biological vision studies and models the physiological processes behind visual perception in humans and other animals,Computer Vision
"Computer vision, on the other hand, develops and describes the algorithms implemented in software and hardware behind artificial vision systems",Computer Vision
"An interdisciplinary exchange between biological and computer vision has proven fruitful for both fields.


=== Signal processing ===
Yet another field related to computer vision is signal processing",Computer Vision
"Many methods for processing one-variable signals, typically temporal signals, can be extended in a natural way to the processing of two-variable signals or multi-variable signals in computer vision",Computer Vision
"However, because of the specific nature of images, there are many methods developed within computer vision that have no counterpart in the processing of one-variable signals",Computer Vision
"Together with the multi-dimensionality of the signal, this defines a subfield in signal processing as a part of computer vision.


=== Robotic navigation ===
Robot navigation sometimes deals with autonomous path planning or deliberation for robotic systems to navigate through an environment",Computer Vision
A detailed understanding of these environments is required to navigate through them,Computer Vision
"Information about the environment could be provided by a computer vision system, acting as a vision sensor and providing high-level information about the environment and the robot


=== Visual computing ===


=== Other fields ===
Besides the above-mentioned views on computer vision, many of the related research topics can also be studied from a purely mathematical point of view",Computer Vision
"For example, many methods in computer vision are based on statistics, optimization or geometry",Computer Vision
"Finally, a significant part of the field is devoted to the implementation aspect of computer vision; how existing methods can be realized in various combinations of software and hardware, or how these methods can be modified in order to gain processing speed without losing too much performance",Computer Vision
"Computer vision is also used in fashion eCommerce, inventory management, patent search, furniture, and the beauty industry.


=== Distinctions ===
The fields most closely related to computer vision are image processing, image analysis and machine vision",Computer Vision
There is a significant overlap in the range of techniques and applications that these cover,Computer Vision
"This implies that the basic techniques that are used and developed in these fields are similar, something which can be interpreted as there is only one field with different names",Computer Vision
"On the other hand, it appears to be necessary for research groups, scientific journals, conferences, and companies to present or market themselves as belonging specifically to one of these fields and, hence, various characterizations which distinguish each of the fields from the others have been presented",Computer Vision
"In image processing, the input is an image and the output is an image as well, whereas in computer vision, an image or a video is taken as an input and the output could be an enhanced image, an understanding of the content of an image or even behavior of a computer system based on such understanding.
Computer graphics produces image data from 3D models, and computer vision often produces 3D models from image data",Computer Vision
"There is also a trend towards a combination of the two disciplines, e.g., as explored in augmented reality.
The following characterizations appear relevant but should not be taken as universally accepted:

Image processing and image analysis tend to focus on 2D images, how to transform one image to another, e.g., by pixel-wise operations such as contrast enhancement, local operations such as edge extraction or noise removal, or geometrical transformations such as rotating the image",Computer Vision
"This characterization implies that image processing/analysis neither requires assumptions nor produces interpretations about the image content.
Computer vision includes 3D analysis from 2D images",Computer Vision
"This analyzes the 3D scene projected onto one or several images, e.g., how to reconstruct structure or other information about the 3D scene from one or several images",Computer Vision
"Computer vision often relies on more or less complex assumptions about the scene depicted in an image.
Machine vision is the process of applying a range of technologies and methods to provide imaging-based automatic inspection, process control, and robot guidance in industrial applications",Computer Vision
"Machine vision tends to focus on applications, mainly in manufacturing, e.g., vision-based robots and systems for vision-based inspection, measurement, or picking (such as bin picking)",Computer Vision
This implies that image sensor technologies and control theory often are integrated with the processing of image data to control a robot and that real-time processing is emphasized by means of efficient implementations in hardware and software,Computer Vision
"It also implies that external conditions such as lighting can be and are often more controlled in machine vision than they are in general computer vision, which can enable the use of different algorithms.
There is also a field called imaging which primarily focuses on the process of producing images, but sometimes also deals with the processing and analysis of images",Computer Vision
"For example, medical imaging includes substantial work on the analysis of image data in medical applications",Computer Vision
"Progress in convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has improved the accurate detection of disease in medical images, particularly in cardiology, pathology, dermatology, and radiology.
Finally, pattern recognition is a field that uses various methods to extract information from signals in general, mainly based on statistical approaches and artificial neural networks",Computer Vision
"A significant part of this field is devoted to applying these methods to image data.
Photogrammetry also overlaps with computer vision, e.g., stereophotogrammetry vs",Computer Vision
"computer stereo vision.


== Applications ==
Applications range from tasks such as industrial machine vision systems which, say, inspect bottles speeding by on a production line, to research into artificial intelligence and computers or robots that can comprehend the world around them",Computer Vision
The computer vision and machine vision fields have significant overlap,Computer Vision
Computer vision covers the core technology of automated image analysis which is used in many fields,Computer Vision
Machine vision usually refers to a process of combining automated image analysis with other methods and technologies to provide automated inspection and robot guidance in industrial applications,Computer Vision
"In many computer-vision applications, computers are pre-programmed to solve a particular task, but methods based on learning are now becoming increasingly common",Computer Vision
"Examples of applications of computer vision include systems for:

Automatic inspection, e.g., in manufacturing applications;
Assisting humans in identification tasks, e.g., a species identification system;
Controlling processes, e.g., an industrial robot;
Detecting events, e.g., for visual surveillance or people counting, e.g., in the restaurant industry;
Interaction, e.g., as the input to a device for computer-human interaction;
monitoring agricultural crops, e.g",Computer Vision
"an open-source vision transformers model  has been developed to help farmers automatically detect strawberry diseases with 98.4% accuracy.
Modeling objects or environments, e.g., medical image analysis or topographical modeling;
Navigation, e.g., by an autonomous vehicle or mobile robot;
Organizing information, e.g., for indexing databases of images and image sequences.
Tracking surfaces or planes in 3D coordinates for allowing Augmented Reality experiences.


=== Medicine ===

One of the most prominent application fields is medical computer vision, or medical image processing, characterized by the extraction of information from image data to diagnose a patient",Computer Vision
"An example of this is the detection of tumours, arteriosclerosis or other malign changes, and a variety of dental pathologies; measurements of organ dimensions, blood flow, etc",Computer Vision
"It also supports medical research by providing new information: e.g., about the structure of the brain or the quality of medical treatments",Computer Vision
"Applications of computer vision in the medical area also include enhancement of images interpreted by humans—ultrasonic images or X-ray images, for example—to reduce the influence of noise.


=== Machine vision ===
A second application area in computer vision is in industry, sometimes called machine vision, where information is extracted for the purpose of supporting a production process",Computer Vision
One example is quality control where details or final products are being automatically inspected in order to find defects,Computer Vision
One of the most prevalent fields for such inspection is the Wafer industry in which every single Wafer is being measured and inspected for inaccuracies or defects to prevent a computer chip from coming to market in an unusable manner,Computer Vision
Another example is a measurement of the position and orientation of details to be picked up by a robot arm,Computer Vision
"Machine vision is also heavily used in the agricultural processes to remove undesirable foodstuff from bulk material, a process called optical sorting.


=== Military ===
Military applications are probably one of the largest areas of computer vision",Computer Vision
The obvious examples are the detection of enemy soldiers or vehicles and missile guidance,Computer Vision
"More advanced systems for missile guidance send the missile to an area rather than a specific target, and target selection is made when the missile reaches the area based on locally acquired image data",Computer Vision
"Modern military concepts, such as ""battlefield awareness"", imply that various sensors, including image sensors, provide a rich set of information about a combat scene that can be used to support strategic decisions",Computer Vision
"In this case, automatic processing of the data is used to reduce complexity and to fuse information from multiple sensors to increase reliability.


=== Autonomous vehicles ===

One of the newer application areas is autonomous vehicles, which include submersibles, land-based vehicles (small robots with wheels, cars, or trucks), aerial vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV)",Computer Vision
The level of autonomy ranges from fully autonomous (unmanned) vehicles to vehicles where computer-vision-based systems support a driver or a pilot in various situations,Computer Vision
"Fully autonomous vehicles typically use computer vision for navigation, e.g., for knowing where they are or mapping their environment (SLAM), for detecting obstacles",Computer Vision
"It can also be used for detecting certain task-specific events, e.g., a UAV looking for forest fires",Computer Vision
"Examples of supporting systems are obstacle warning systems in cars, cameras and LiDAR sensors in vehicles, and systems for autonomous landing of aircraft",Computer Vision
Several car manufacturers have demonstrated systems for autonomous driving of cars,Computer Vision
There are ample examples of military autonomous vehicles ranging from advanced missiles to UAVs for recon missions or missile guidance,Computer Vision
"Space exploration is already being made with autonomous vehicles using computer vision, e.g., NASA's Curiosity and CNSA's Yutu-2 rover.


=== Tactile feedback ===

Materials such as rubber and silicon are being used to create sensors that allow for applications such as detecting microundulations and calibrating robotic hands",Computer Vision
"Rubber can be used in order to create a mold that can be placed over a finger, inside of this mold would be multiple strain gauges",Computer Vision
The finger mold and sensors could then be placed on top of a small sheet of rubber containing an array of rubber pins,Computer Vision
A user can then wear the finger mold and trace a surface,Computer Vision
A computer can then read the data from the strain gauges and measure if one or more of the pins are being pushed upward,Computer Vision
If a pin is being pushed upward then the computer can recognize this as an imperfection in the surface,Computer Vision
This sort of technology is useful in order to receive accurate data on imperfections on a very large surface,Computer Vision
Another variation of this finger mold sensor are sensors that contain a camera suspended in silicon,Computer Vision
The silicon forms a dome around the outside of the camera and embedded in the silicon are point markers that are equally spaced,Computer Vision
"These cameras can then be placed on devices such as robotic hands in order to allow the computer to receive highly accurate tactile data.
Other application areas include:

Support of visual effects creation for cinema and broadcast, e.g., camera tracking (match moving).
Surveillance.
Driver drowsiness detection
Tracking and counting organisms in the biological sciences


== Typical tasks ==
Each of the application areas described above employ a range of computer vision tasks; more or less well-defined measurement problems or processing problems, which can be solved using a variety of methods",Computer Vision
"Some examples of typical computer vision tasks are presented below.
Computer vision tasks include methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing and understanding digital images, and extraction of high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions",Computer Vision
Understanding in this context means the transformation of visual images (the input of the retina) into descriptions of the world that can interface with other thought processes and elicit appropriate action,Computer Vision
"This image understanding can be seen as the disentangling of symbolic information from image data using models constructed with the aid of geometry, physics, statistics, and learning theory.


=== Recognition ===
The classical problem in computer vision, image processing, and machine vision is that of determining whether or not the image data contains some specific object, feature, or activity",Computer Vision
"Different varieties of recognition problem are described in the literature.

Object recognition (also called object classification) – one or several pre-specified or learned objects or object classes can be recognized, usually together with their 2D positions in the image or 3D poses in the scene",Computer Vision
"Blippar, Google Goggles, and LikeThat provide stand-alone programs that illustrate this functionality.
Identification – an individual instance of an object is recognized",Computer Vision
"Examples include identification of a specific person's face or fingerprint, identification of handwritten digits, or the identification of a specific vehicle.
Detection – the image data are scanned for specific objects along with their locations",Computer Vision
Examples include the detection of an obstacle in the car's field of view and possible abnormal cells or tissues in medical images or the detection of a vehicle in an automatic road toll system,Computer Vision
"Detection based on relatively simple and fast computations is sometimes used for finding smaller regions of interesting image data which can be further analyzed by more computationally demanding techniques to produce a correct interpretation.
Currently, the best algorithms for such tasks are based on convolutional neural networks",Computer Vision
"An illustration of their capabilities is given by the ImageNet Large Scale Visual Recognition Challenge; this is a benchmark in object classification and detection, with millions of images and 1000 object classes used in the competition",Computer Vision
Performance of convolutional neural networks on the ImageNet tests is now close to that of humans,Computer Vision
"The best algorithms still struggle with objects that are small or thin, such as a small ant on the stem of a flower or a person holding a quill in their hand",Computer Vision
They also have trouble with images that have been distorted with filters (an increasingly common phenomenon with modern digital cameras),Computer Vision
"For example, they are not good at classifying objects into fine-grained classes, such as the particular breed of dog or species of bird, whereas convolutional neural networks handle this with ease.
Several specialized tasks based on recognition exist, such as:

Content-based image retrieval – finding all images in a larger set of images which have a specific content",Computer Vision
"The content can be specified in different ways, for example in terms of similarity relative to a target image (give me all images similar to image X) by utilizing reverse image search techniques, or in terms of high-level search criteria given as text input (give me all images which contain many houses, are taken during winter and have no cars in them).

Pose estimation – estimating the position or orientation of a specific object relative to the camera",Computer Vision
"An example application for this technique would be assisting a robot arm in retrieving objects from a conveyor belt in an assembly line situation or picking parts from a bin.
Optical character recognition (OCR) – identifying characters in images of printed or handwritten text, usually with a view to encoding the text in a format more amenable to editing or indexing (e.g",Computer Vision
"A related task is reading of 2D codes such as data matrix and QR codes.
Facial recognition –  a technology that enables the matching of faces in digital images or video frames to a face database, which is now widely used for mobile phone facelock, smart door locking, etc.
Emotion recognition – a subset of facial recognition, emotion recognition refers to the process of classifying human emotions",Computer Vision
"Psychologists caution, however, that internal emotions cannot be reliably detected from faces.
Shape Recognition Technology (SRT) in people counter systems differentiating human beings (head and shoulder patterns) from objects.
Human activity recognition - deals with recognizing the activity from a series of video frames, such as, if the person is picking up an object or walking.


=== Motion analysis ===
Several tasks relate to motion estimation, where an image sequence is processed to produce an estimate of the velocity either at each points in the image or in the 3D scene or even of the camera that produces the images",Computer Vision
"Examples of such tasks are:

Egomotion – determining the 3D rigid motion (rotation and translation) of the camera from an image sequence produced by the camera.
Tracking – following the movements of a (usually) smaller set of interest points or objects (e.g., vehicles, objects, humans or other organisms) in the image sequence",Computer Vision
"This has vast industry applications as most high-running machinery can be monitored in this way.
Optical flow – to determine, for each point in the image, how that point is moving relative to the image plane, i.e., its apparent motion",Computer Vision
"This motion is a result of both how the corresponding 3D point is moving in the scene and how the camera is moving relative to the scene.


=== Scene reconstruction ===
Given one or (typically) more images of a scene, or a video, scene reconstruction aims at computing a 3D model of the scene",Computer Vision
"In the simplest case, the model can be a set of 3D points",Computer Vision
"The advent of 3D imaging not requiring motion or scanning, and related processing algorithms is enabling rapid advances in this field",Computer Vision
Grid-based 3D sensing can be used to acquire 3D images from multiple angles,Computer Vision
"Algorithms are now available to stitch multiple 3D images together into point clouds and 3D models.


=== Image restoration ===
Image restoration comes into the picture when the original image is degraded or damaged due to some external factors like lens wrong positioning, transmission interference, low lighting or motion blurs, etc., which is referred to as noise",Computer Vision
"When the images are degraded or damaged, the information to be extracted from them also gets damaged",Computer Vision
"Therefore, we need to recover or restore the image as it was intended to be",Computer Vision
"The aim of image restoration is the removal of noise (sensor noise, motion blur, etc.) from images",Computer Vision
"The simplest possible approach for noise removal is various types of filters, such as low-pass filters or median filters",Computer Vision
More sophisticated methods assume a model of how the local image structures look to distinguish them from noise,Computer Vision
"By first analyzing the image data in terms of the local image structures, such as lines or edges, and then controlling the filtering based on local information from the analysis step, a better level of noise removal is usually obtained compared to the simpler approaches.
An example in this field is inpainting.


== System methods ==
The organization of a computer vision system is highly application-dependent",Computer Vision
"Some systems are stand-alone applications that solve a specific measurement or detection problem, while others constitute a sub-system of a larger design which, for example, also contains sub-systems for control of mechanical actuators, planning, information databases, man-machine interfaces, etc",Computer Vision
The specific implementation of a computer vision system also depends on whether its functionality is pre-specified or if some part of it can be learned or modified during operation,Computer Vision
"There are, however, typical functions that are found in many computer vision systems.

Image acquisition – A digital image is produced by one or several image sensors, which, besides various types of light-sensitive cameras, include range sensors, tomography devices, radar, ultra-sonic cameras, etc",Computer Vision
"Depending on the type of sensor, the resulting image data is an ordinary 2D image, a 3D volume, or an image sequence",Computer Vision
"The pixel values typically correspond to light intensity in one or several spectral bands (gray images or colour images) but can also be related to various physical measures, such as depth, absorption or reflectance of sonic or electromagnetic waves, or magnetic resonance imaging.
Pre-processing – Before a computer vision method can be applied to image data in order to extract some specific piece of information, it is usually necessary to process the data in order to ensure that it satisfies certain assumptions implied by the method",Computer Vision
"Examples are:
Re-sampling to ensure that the image coordinate system is correct.
Noise reduction to ensure that sensor noise does not introduce false information.
Contrast enhancement to ensure that relevant information can be detected.
Scale space representation to enhance image structures at locally appropriate scales.
Feature extraction – Image features at various levels of complexity are extracted from the image data",Computer Vision
"Typical examples of such features are:
Lines, edges and ridges.
Localized interest points such as corners, blobs or points.
More complex features may be related to texture, shape, or motion.
Detection/segmentation – At some point in the processing, a decision is made about which image points or regions of the image are relevant for further processing",Computer Vision
"Examples are:
Selection of a specific set of interest points.
Segmentation of one or multiple image regions that contain a specific object of interest.
Segmentation of image into nested scene architecture comprising foreground, object groups, single objects or salient object parts (also referred to as spatial-taxon scene hierarchy), while the visual salience is often implemented as spatial and temporal attention.
Segmentation or co-segmentation of one or multiple videos into a series of per-frame foreground masks while maintaining its temporal semantic continuity.
High-level processing – At this step, the input is typically a small set of data, for example, a set of points or an image region, which is assumed to contain a specific object",Computer Vision
"The remaining processing deals with, for example:
Verification that the data satisfies model-based and application-specific assumptions.
Estimation of application-specific parameters, such as object pose or object size.
Image recognition – classifying a detected object into different categories.
Image registration – comparing and combining two different views of the same object.
Decision making Making the final decision required for the application, for example:
Pass/fail on automatic inspection applications.
Match/no-match in recognition applications.
Flag for further human review in medical, military, security and recognition applications.


=== Image-understanding systems ===
Image-understanding systems (IUS) include three levels of abstraction as follows: low level includes image primitives such as edges, texture elements, or regions; intermediate level includes boundaries, surfaces and volumes; and high level includes objects, scenes, or events",Computer Vision
"Many of these requirements are entirely topics for further research.
The representational requirements in the designing of IUS for these levels are: representation of prototypical concepts, concept organization, spatial knowledge, temporal knowledge, scaling, and description by comparison and differentiation.
While inference refers to the process of deriving new, not explicitly represented facts from currently known facts, control refers to the process that selects which of the many inference, search, and matching techniques should be applied at a particular stage of processing",Computer Vision
"Inference and control requirements for IUS are: search and hypothesis activation, matching and hypothesis testing, generation and use of expectations, change and focus of attention, certainty and strength of belief, inference and goal satisfaction.


== Hardware ==

There are many kinds of computer vision systems; however, all of them contain these basic elements: a power source, at least one image acquisition device (camera, ccd, etc.), a processor, and control and communication cables or some kind of wireless interconnection mechanism",Computer Vision
"In addition, a practical vision system contains software, as well as a display in order to monitor the system",Computer Vision
"Vision systems for inner spaces, as most industrial ones, contain an illumination system and may be placed in a controlled environment",Computer Vision
"Furthermore, a completed system includes many accessories, such as camera supports, cables, and connectors.
Most computer vision systems use visible-light cameras passively viewing a scene at frame rates of at most 60 frames per second (usually far slower).
A few computer vision systems use image-acquisition hardware with active illumination or something other than visible light or both, such as structured-light 3D scanners, thermographic cameras, hyperspectral imagers, radar imaging, lidar scanners, magnetic resonance images, side-scan sonar, synthetic aperture sonar, etc",Computer Vision
"Such hardware captures ""images"" that are then processed often using the same computer vision algorithms used to process visible-light images.
While traditional broadcast and consumer video systems operate at a rate of 30 frames per second, advances in digital signal processing and consumer graphics hardware has made high-speed image acquisition, processing, and display possible for real-time systems on the order of hundreds to thousands of frames per second",Computer Vision
"For applications in robotics, fast, real-time video systems are critically important and often can simplify the processing needed for certain algorithms",Computer Vision
"When combined with a high-speed projector, fast image acquisition allows 3D measurement and feature tracking to be realized.
Egocentric vision systems are composed of a wearable camera that automatically take pictures from a first-person perspective.
As of 2016, vision processing units are emerging as a new class of processors to complement CPUs and graphics processing units (GPUs) in this role.

== History ==
The first definition of the term bioinformatics was coined by Paulien Hogeweg and Ben Hesper in 1970, to refer to the study of information processes in biotic systems",Bioinformatics
"This definition placed bioinformatics as a field parallel to biochemistry (the study of chemical processes in biological systems).
Bioinformatics and computational biology involved the analysis of biological data, particularly DNA, RNA, and protein sequences",Bioinformatics
"The field of bioinformatics experienced explosive growth starting in the mid-1990s, driven largely by the Human Genome Project and by rapid advances in DNA sequencing technology.
Analyzing biological data to produce meaningful information involves writing and running software programs that use algorithms from graph theory, artificial intelligence, soft computing, data mining, image processing, and computer simulation",Bioinformatics
"The algorithms in turn depend on theoretical foundations such as discrete mathematics, control theory, system theory, information theory, and statistics.


=== Sequences ===

There has been a tremendous advance in speed and cost reduction since the completion of the Human Genome Project, with some labs able to sequence over 100,000 billion bases each year, and a full genome can be sequenced for $1,000 or less.
Computers became essential in molecular biology when protein sequences became available after Frederick Sanger determined the sequence of insulin in the early 1950s",Bioinformatics
"Margaret Oakley Dayhoff, a pioneer in the field, compiled one of the first protein sequence databases, initially published as books as well as methods of sequence alignment and molecular evolution",Bioinformatics
"Kabat, who pioneered biological sequence analysis in 1970 with his comprehensive volumes of antibody sequences released online with Tai Te Wu between 1980 and 1991.
In the 1970s, new techniques for sequencing DNA were applied to bacteriophage MS2 and øX174, and the extended nucleotide sequences were then parsed with informational and statistical algorithms",Bioinformatics
"These studies illustrated that well known features, such as the coding segments and the triplet code, are revealed in straightforward statistical analyses and were the proof of the concept that bioinformatics would be insightful.


== Goals ==
In order to study how normal cellular activities are altered in different disease states, raw biological data must be combined to form a comprehensive picture of these activities",Bioinformatics
"Therefore, the field of bioinformatics has evolved such that the most pressing task now involves the analysis and interpretation of various types of data",Bioinformatics
"This also includes nucleotide and amino acid sequences, protein domains, and protein structures.
Important sub-disciplines within bioinformatics and computational biology include:

Development and implementation of computer programs to efficiently access, manage, and use various types of information.
Development of new mathematical algorithms and statistical measures to assess relationships among members of large data sets",Bioinformatics
"For example, there are methods to locate a gene within a sequence, to predict protein structure and/or function, and to cluster protein sequences into families of related sequences.
The primary goal of bioinformatics is to increase the understanding of biological processes",Bioinformatics
What sets it apart from other approaches is its focus on developing and applying computationally intensive techniques to achieve this goal,Bioinformatics
"Examples include: pattern recognition, data mining, machine learning algorithms, and visualization",Bioinformatics
"Major research efforts in the field include sequence alignment, gene finding, genome assembly, drug design, drug discovery, protein structure alignment, protein structure prediction, prediction of gene expression and protein–protein interactions, genome-wide association studies, the modeling of evolution and cell division/mitosis.
Bioinformatics entails the creation and advancement of databases, algorithms, computational and statistical techniques, and theory to solve formal and practical problems arising from the management and analysis of biological data.
Over the past few decades, rapid developments in genomic and other molecular research technologies and developments in information technologies have combined to produce a tremendous amount of information related to molecular biology",Bioinformatics
"Bioinformatics is the name given to these mathematical and computing approaches used to glean understanding of biological processes.
Common activities in bioinformatics include mapping and analyzing DNA and protein sequences, aligning DNA and protein sequences to compare them, and creating and viewing 3-D models of protein structures.


== Sequence analysis ==

Since the bacteriophage Phage Φ-X174 was sequenced in 1977, the DNA sequences of thousands of organisms have been decoded and stored in databases",Bioinformatics
"This sequence information is analyzed to determine genes that encode proteins, RNA genes, regulatory sequences, structural motifs, and repetitive sequences",Bioinformatics
"A comparison of genes within a species or between different species can show similarities between protein functions, or relations between species (the use of molecular systematics to construct phylogenetic trees)",Bioinformatics
"With the growing amount of data, it long ago became impractical to analyze DNA sequences manually",Bioinformatics
"Computer programs such as BLAST are used routinely to search sequences—as of 2008, from more than 260,000 organisms, containing over 190 billion nucleotides.


=== DNA sequencing ===

Before sequences can be analyzed, they are obtained from a data storage bank, such as GenBank",Bioinformatics
DNA sequencing is still a non-trivial problem as the raw data may be noisy or affected by weak signals,Bioinformatics
"Algorithms have been developed for base calling for the various experimental approaches to DNA sequencing.


=== Sequence assembly ===

Most DNA sequencing techniques produce short fragments of sequence that need to be assembled to obtain complete gene or genome sequences",Bioinformatics
"The shotgun sequencing technique (used by The Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) to sequence the first bacterial genome, Haemophilus influenzae) generates the sequences of many thousands of small DNA fragments (ranging from 35 to 900 nucleotides long, depending on the sequencing technology)",Bioinformatics
"The ends of these fragments overlap and, when aligned properly by a genome assembly program, can be used to reconstruct the complete genome",Bioinformatics
"Shotgun sequencing yields sequence data quickly, but the task of assembling the fragments can be quite complicated for larger genomes",Bioinformatics
"For a genome as large as the human genome, it may take many days of CPU time on large-memory, multiprocessor computers to assemble the fragments, and the resulting assembly usually contains numerous gaps that must be filled in later",Bioinformatics
"Shotgun sequencing is the method of choice for virtually all genomes sequenced (rather than chain-termination or chemical degradation methods), and genome assembly algorithms are a critical area of bioinformatics research.


=== Genome annotation ===

In genomics, annotation refers to the process of marking the stop and start regions of genes and other biological features in a sequenced DNA sequence",Bioinformatics
Many genomes are too large to be annotated by hand,Bioinformatics
"As the rate of sequencing exceeds the rate of genome annotation, genome annotation has become the new bottleneck in bioinformatics.
Genome annotation can be classified into three levels: the nucleotide, protein, and process levels.
Gene finding is a chief aspect of nucleotide-level annotation",Bioinformatics
"For complex genomes, a combination of ab initio gene prediction and sequence comparison with expressed sequence databases and other organisms can be successful",Bioinformatics
"Nucleotide-level annotation also allows the integration of genome sequence with other genetic and physical maps of the genome.
The principal aim of protein-level annotation is to assign function to the protein products of the genome",Bioinformatics
Databases of protein sequences and functional domains and motifs are used for this type of annotation,Bioinformatics
"About half of the predicted proteins in a new genome sequence tend to have no obvious function.
Understanding the function of genes and their products in the context of cellular and organismal physiology is the goal of process-level annotation",Bioinformatics
An obstacle of process-level annotation has been the inconsistency of terms used by different model systems,Bioinformatics
"The Gene Ontology Consortium is helping to solve this problem.
The first description of a comprehensive annotation system was published in 1995 by The Institute for Genomic Research, which performed the first complete sequencing and analysis of the genome of a free-living (non-symbiotic) organism, the bacterium Haemophilus influenzae",Bioinformatics
"The system identifies the genes encoding all proteins, transfer RNAs, ribosomal RNAs, in order to make initial functional assignments",Bioinformatics
"The GeneMark program trained to find protein-coding genes in Haemophilus influenzae is constantly changing and improving.
Following the goals that the Human Genome Project left to achieve after its closure in 2003, the ENCODE project was developed by the National Human Genome Research Institute",Bioinformatics
"This project is a collaborative data collection of the functional elements of the human genome that uses next-generation DNA-sequencing technologies and genomic tiling arrays, technologies able to automatically generate large amounts of data at a dramatically reduced per-base cost but with the same accuracy (base call error) and fidelity (assembly error).


==== Gene function prediction ====
While genome annotation is primarily based on sequence similarity (and thus homology), other properties of sequences can be used to predict the function of genes",Bioinformatics
"In fact, most gene function prediction methods focus on protein sequences as they are more informative and more feature-rich",Bioinformatics
"For instance, the distribution of hydrophobic amino acids predicts transmembrane segments in proteins",Bioinformatics
"However, protein function prediction can also use external information such as gene (or protein) expression data, protein structure, or protein-protein interactions.


=== Computational evolutionary biology ===

Evolutionary biology is the study of the origin and descent of species, as well as their change over time",Bioinformatics
"Informatics has assisted evolutionary biologists by enabling researchers to:

trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their DNA, rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone,
compare entire genomes, which permits the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as gene duplication, horizontal gene transfer, and the prediction of factors important in bacterial speciation,
build complex computational population genetics models to predict the outcome of the system over time
track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms
Future work endeavours to reconstruct the now more complex tree of life.


=== Comparative genomics ===

The core of comparative genome analysis is the establishment of the correspondence between genes (orthology analysis) or other genomic features in different organisms",Bioinformatics
Intergenomic maps are made to trace the evolutionary processes responsible for the divergence of two genomes,Bioinformatics
A multitude of evolutionary events acting at various organizational levels shape genome evolution,Bioinformatics
"At a higher level, large chromosomal segments undergo duplication, lateral transfer, inversion, transposition, deletion and insertion",Bioinformatics
"Entire genomes are involved in processes of hybridization, polyploidization and endosymbiosis that lead to rapid speciation",Bioinformatics
"The complexity of genome evolution poses many exciting challenges to developers of mathematical models and algorithms, who have recourse to a spectrum of algorithmic, statistical and mathematical techniques, ranging from exact, heuristics, fixed parameter and approximation algorithms for problems based on parsimony models to Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms for Bayesian analysis of problems based on probabilistic models.
Many of these studies are based on the detection of sequence homology to assign sequences to protein families.


=== Pan genomics ===

Pan genomics is a concept introduced in 2005 by Tettelin and Medini",Bioinformatics
Pan genome is the complete gene repertoire of a particular monophyletic taxonomic group,Bioinformatics
"Although initially applied to closely related strains of a species, it can be applied to a larger context like genus, phylum, etc",Bioinformatics
"It is divided in two parts: the Core genome, a set of genes common to all the genomes under study (often housekeeping genes vital for survival), and the Dispensable/Flexible genome: a set of genes not present in all but one or some genomes under study",Bioinformatics
"A bioinformatics tool BPGA can be used to characterize the Pan Genome of bacterial species.


=== Genetics of disease ===

As of 2013, the existence of efficient high-throughput next-generation sequencing technology allows for the identification of cause many different human disorders",Bioinformatics
"Simple Mendelian inheritance has been observed for over 3,000 disorders that have been identified at the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man database, but complex diseases are more difficult",Bioinformatics
"Association studies have found many individual genetic regions that individually are weakly associated with complex diseases (such as infertility, breast cancer and Alzheimer's disease), rather than a single cause",Bioinformatics
"There are currently many challenges to using genes for diagnosis and treatment, such as how we don't know which genes are important, or how stable the choices an algorithm provides",Bioinformatics
"
Genome-wide association studies have successfully identified thousands of common genetic variants for complex diseases and traits; however, these common variants only explain a small fraction of heritability",Bioinformatics
Rare variants may account for some of the missing heritability,Bioinformatics
"Large-scale whole genome sequencing studies have rapidly sequenced millions of whole genomes, and such studies have identified hundreds of millions of rare variants",Bioinformatics
"Functional annotations predict the effect or function of a genetic variant and help to prioritize rare functional variants, and incorporating these annotations can effectively boost the power of genetic association of rare variants analysis of whole genome sequencing studies",Bioinformatics
"Some tools have been developed to provide all-in-one rare variant association analysis for whole-genome sequencing data, including integration of genotype data and their functional annotations, association analysis, result summary and visualization",Bioinformatics
"Meta-analysis of whole genome sequencing studies provides an attractive solution to the problem of collecting large sample sizes for discovering rare variants associated with complex phenotypes.


=== Analysis of mutations in cancer ===

In cancer, the genomes of affected cells are rearranged in complex or unpredictable ways",Bioinformatics
"In addition to single-nucleotide polymorphism arrays identifying point mutations that cause cancer, oligonucleotide microarrays can be used to identify chromosomal gains and losses (called comparative genomic hybridization)",Bioinformatics
"The data is often found to contain considerable variability, or noise, and thus Hidden Markov model and change-point analysis methods are being developed to infer real copy number changes.
Two important principles can be used to identify cancer by mutations in the exome",Bioinformatics
"First, cancer is a disease of accumulated somatic mutations in genes",Bioinformatics
"Second, cancer contains driver mutations which need to be distinguished from passengers.
Further improvements in bioinformatics could allow for classifying types of cancer by analysis of cancer driven mutations in the genome",Bioinformatics
"Furthermore, tracking of patients while the disease progresses may be possible in the future with the sequence of cancer samples",Bioinformatics
"Another type of data that requires novel informatics development is the analysis of lesions found to be recurrent among many tumors.


== Gene and protein expression ==


=== Analysis of gene expression ===
The expression of many genes can be determined by measuring mRNA levels with multiple techniques including microarrays, expressed cDNA sequence tag (EST) sequencing, serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) tag sequencing, massively parallel signature sequencing (MPSS), RNA-Seq, also known as ""Whole Transcriptome Shotgun Sequencing"" (WTSS), or various applications of multiplexed in-situ hybridization",Bioinformatics
"All of these techniques are extremely noise-prone and/or subject to bias in the biological measurement, and a major research area in computational biology involves developing statistical tools to separate signal from noise in high-throughput gene expression studies",Bioinformatics
"Such studies are often used to determine the genes implicated in a disorder: one might compare microarray data from cancerous epithelial cells to data from non-cancerous cells to determine the transcripts that are up-regulated and down-regulated in a particular population of cancer cells.


=== Analysis of protein expression ===
Protein microarrays and high throughput (HT) mass spectrometry (MS) can provide a snapshot of the proteins present in a biological sample",Bioinformatics
"The former approach faces similar problems as with microarrays targeted at mRNA, the latter involves the problem of matching large amounts of mass data against predicted masses from protein sequence databases, and the complicated statistical analysis of samples when multiple incomplete peptides from each protein are detected",Bioinformatics
"Cellular protein localization in a tissue context can be achieved through affinity proteomics displayed as spatial data based on immunohistochemistry and tissue microarrays.


=== Analysis of regulation ===
Gene regulation is a complex process where a signal, such as an extracellular signal such as a hormone, eventually leads to an increase or decrease in the activity of one or more proteins",Bioinformatics
"Bioinformatics techniques have been applied to explore various steps in this process.
For example, gene expression can be regulated by nearby elements in the genome",Bioinformatics
Promoter analysis involves the identification and study of sequence motifs in the DNA surrounding the protein-coding region of a gene,Bioinformatics
These motifs influence the extent to which that region is transcribed into mRNA,Bioinformatics
"Enhancer elements far away from the promoter can also regulate gene expression, through three-dimensional looping interactions",Bioinformatics
"These interactions can be determined by bioinformatic analysis of chromosome conformation capture experiments.
Expression data can be used to infer gene regulation: one might compare microarray data from a wide variety of states of an organism to form hypotheses about the genes involved in each state",Bioinformatics
"In a single-cell organism, one might compare stages of the cell cycle, along with various stress conditions (heat shock, starvation, etc.)",Bioinformatics
Clustering algorithms can be then applied to expression data to determine which genes are co-expressed,Bioinformatics
"For example, the upstream regions (promoters) of co-expressed genes can be searched for over-represented regulatory elements",Bioinformatics
"Examples of clustering algorithms applied in gene clustering are k-means clustering, self-organizing maps (SOMs), hierarchical clustering, and consensus clustering methods.


== Analysis of cellular organization ==
Several approaches have been developed to analyze the location of organelles, genes, proteins, and other components within cells",Bioinformatics
"A gene ontology category, cellular component, has been devised to capture subcellular localization in many biological databases.


=== Microscopy and image analysis ===
Microscopic pictures allow for the location of organelles as well as molecules, which may be the source of abnormalities in diseases.


=== Protein localization ===
Finding the location of proteins allows us to predict what they do",Bioinformatics
"For instance, if a protein is found in the nucleus it may be involved in gene regulation or splicing",Bioinformatics
"By contrast, if a protein is found in mitochondria, it may be involved in respiration or other metabolic processes",Bioinformatics
"There are well developed protein subcellular localization prediction resources available, including protein subcellular location databases, and prediction tools.


=== Nuclear organization of chromatin ===

Data from high-throughput chromosome conformation capture experiments, such as Hi-C (experiment) and ChIA-PET, can provide information on the three-dimensional structure and nuclear organization of chromatin",Bioinformatics
"Bioinformatic challenges in this field include partitioning the genome into domains, such as Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), that are organised together in three-dimensional space.


== Structural bioinformatics ==

Finding the structure of proteins is an important application of bioinformatics",Bioinformatics
"The Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction (CASP) is an open competition where worldwide research groups submit protein models for evaluating unknown protein models.


=== Amino acid sequence ===
The linear amino acid sequence of a protein is called the primary structure",Bioinformatics
The primary structure can be easily determined from the sequence of codons on the DNA gene that codes for it,Bioinformatics
"In most proteins, the primary structure uniquely determines the 3-dimensional structure of a protein in its native environment",Bioinformatics
An exception is the misfolded protein involved in bovine spongiform encephalopathy,Bioinformatics
This structure is linked to the function of the protein,Bioinformatics
"Additional structural information includes the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure",Bioinformatics
A viable general solution to the prediction of the function of a protein remains an open problem,Bioinformatics
"Most efforts have so far been directed towards heuristics that work most of the time.


=== Homology ===
In the genomic branch of bioinformatics, homology is used to predict the function of a gene: if the sequence of gene A, whose function is known, is homologous to the sequence of gene B, whose function is unknown, one could infer that B may share A's function",Bioinformatics
"In structural bioinformatics, homology is used to determine which parts of a protein are important in structure formation and interaction with other proteins",Bioinformatics
"Homology modeling is used to predict the structure of an unknown protein from existing homologous proteins.
One example of this is hemoglobin in humans and the hemoglobin in legumes (leghemoglobin), which are distant relatives from the same protein superfamily",Bioinformatics
Both serve the same purpose of transporting oxygen in the organism,Bioinformatics
"Although both of these proteins have completely different amino acid sequences, their protein structures are virtually identical, which reflects their near identical purposes and shared ancestor.
Other techniques for predicting protein structure include protein threading and de novo (from scratch) physics-based modeling.
Another aspect of structural bioinformatics include the use of protein structures for Virtual Screening models such as Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship models and proteochemometric models (PCM)",Bioinformatics
"Furthermore, a protein's crystal structure can be used in simulation of for example ligand-binding studies and in silico mutagenesis studies.
A 2021 deep-learning algorithms-based software called AlphaFold, developed by Google's DeepMind, greatly outperforms all other prediction software methods, and has released predicted structures for hundreds of millions of proteins in the AlphaFold protein structure database.


== Network and systems biology ==

Network analysis seeks to understand the relationships within biological networks such as metabolic or protein–protein interaction networks",Bioinformatics
"Although biological networks can be constructed from a single type of molecule or entity (such as genes), network biology often attempts to integrate many different data types, such as proteins, small molecules, gene expression data, and others, which are all connected physically, functionally, or both.
Systems biology involves the use of computer simulations of cellular subsystems (such as the networks of metabolites and enzymes that comprise metabolism, signal transduction pathways and gene regulatory networks) to both analyze and visualize the complex connections of these cellular processes",Bioinformatics
"Artificial life or virtual evolution attempts to understand evolutionary processes via the computer simulation of simple (artificial) life forms.


=== Molecular interaction networks ===

Tens of thousands of three-dimensional protein structures have been determined by X-ray crystallography and protein nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (protein NMR) and a central question in structural bioinformatics is whether it is practical to predict possible protein–protein interactions only based on these 3D shapes, without performing protein–protein interaction experiments",Bioinformatics
"A variety of methods have been developed to tackle the protein–protein docking problem, though it seems that there is still much work to be done in this field.
Other interactions encountered in the field include Protein–ligand (including drug) and protein–peptide",Bioinformatics
"Molecular dynamic simulation of movement of atoms about rotatable bonds is the fundamental principle behind computational algorithms, termed docking algorithms, for studying molecular interactions.


== Biodiversity informatics ==

Biodiversity informatics deals with the collection and analysis of biodiversity data, such as taxonomic databases, or microbiome data",Bioinformatics
"Examples of such analyses include phylogenetics, niche modelling, species richness mapping, DNA barcoding, or species identification tools",Bioinformatics
"the study of how biodiversity is connected to ecology and human impact, such as climate change.


== Others ==


=== Literature analysis ===

The enormous number of published literature makes it virtually impossible for individuals to read every paper, resulting in disjointed sub-fields of research",Bioinformatics
Literature analysis aims to employ computational and statistical linguistics to mine this growing library of text resources,Bioinformatics
"For example:

Abbreviation recognition – identify the long-form and abbreviation of biological terms
Named-entity recognition – recognizing biological terms such as gene names
Protein–protein interaction – identify which proteins interact with which proteins from text
The area of research draws from statistics and computational linguistics.


=== High-throughput image analysis ===
Computational technologies are used to automate the processing, quantification and analysis of large amounts of high-information-content biomedical imagery",Bioinformatics
"Modern image analysis systems can improve an observer's accuracy, objectivity, or speed",Bioinformatics
"Some examples are:

high-throughput and high-fidelity quantification and sub-cellular localization (high-content screening, cytohistopathology, Bioimage informatics)
morphometrics
clinical image analysis and visualization
determining the real-time air-flow patterns in breathing lungs of living animals
quantifying occlusion size in real-time imagery from the development of and recovery during arterial injury
making behavioral observations from extended video recordings of laboratory animals
infrared measurements for metabolic activity determination
inferring clone overlaps in DNA mapping, e.g",Bioinformatics
"the Sulston score


=== High-throughput single cell data analysis ===

Computational techniques are used to analyse high-throughput, low-measurement single cell data, such as that obtained from flow cytometry",Bioinformatics
"These methods typically involve finding populations of cells that are relevant to a particular disease state or experimental condition.


=== Ontologies and data integration ===
Biological ontologies are directed acyclic graphs of controlled vocabularies",Bioinformatics
They create categories for biological concepts and descriptions so they can be easily analyzed with computers,Bioinformatics
"When categorised in this way, it is possible to gain added value from holistic and integrated analysis.
The OBO Foundry was an effort to standardise certain ontologies",Bioinformatics
One of the most widespread is the Gene ontology which describes gene function,Bioinformatics
"There are also ontologies which describe phenotypes.


== Databases ==

Databases are essential for bioinformatics research and applications",Bioinformatics
"Databases exist for many different information types, including DNA and protein sequences, molecular structures, phenotypes and biodiversity",Bioinformatics
Databases can contain both empirical data (obtained directly from experiments) and predicted data (obtained from analysis of existing data),Bioinformatics
"They may be specific to a particular organism, pathway or molecule of interest",Bioinformatics
"Alternatively, they can incorporate data compiled from multiple other databases",Bioinformatics
"Databases can have different formats, access mechanisms, and be public or private.
Some of the most commonly used databases are listed below:

Used in biological sequence analysis: Genbank, UniProt
Used in structure analysis: Protein Data Bank (PDB)
Used in finding Protein Families and Motif Finding: InterPro, Pfam
Used for Next Generation Sequencing: Sequence Read Archive
Used in Network Analysis: Metabolic Pathway Databases (KEGG, BioCyc), Interaction Analysis Databases, Functional Networks
Used in design of synthetic genetic circuits: GenoCAD


== Software and tools ==
Software tools for bioinformatics include simple command-line tools, more complex graphical programs, and standalone web-services",Bioinformatics
"They are made by bioinformatics companies or by public institutions.


=== Open-source bioinformatics software ===

Many free and open-source software tools have existed and continued to grow since the 1980s",Bioinformatics
"The combination of a continued need for new algorithms for the analysis of emerging types of biological readouts, the potential for innovative in silico experiments, and freely available open code bases have created opportunities for research groups to contribute to both bioinformatics regardless of funding",Bioinformatics
"The open source tools often act as incubators of ideas, or community-supported plug-ins in commercial applications",Bioinformatics
"They may also provide de facto standards and shared object models for assisting with the challenge of bioinformation integration.
Open-source bioinformatics software includes Bioconductor, BioPerl, Biopython, BioJava, BioJS, BioRuby, Bioclipse, EMBOSS, .NET Bio, Orange with its bioinformatics add-on, Apache Taverna, UGENE and GenoCAD.
The non-profit Open Bioinformatics Foundation and the annual Bioinformatics Open Source Conference promote open-source bioinformatics software.


=== Web services in bioinformatics ===
SOAP- and REST-based interfaces have been developed to allow client computers to use algorithms, data and computing resources from servers in other parts of the world",Bioinformatics
"The main advantage are that end users do not have to deal with software and database maintenance overheads.
Basic bioinformatics services are classified by the EBI into three categories: SSS (Sequence Search Services), MSA (Multiple Sequence Alignment), and BSA (Biological Sequence Analysis)",Bioinformatics
"The availability of these service-oriented bioinformatics resources demonstrate the applicability of web-based bioinformatics solutions, and range from a collection of standalone tools with a common data format under a single web-based interface, to integrative, distributed and extensible bioinformatics workflow management systems.


==== Bioinformatics workflow management systems ====

A bioinformatics workflow management system is a specialized form of a workflow management system designed specifically to compose and execute a series of computational or data manipulation steps, or a workflow, in a Bioinformatics application",Bioinformatics
"Such systems are designed to

provide an easy-to-use environment for individual application scientists themselves to create their own workflows,
provide interactive tools for the scientists enabling them to execute their workflows and view their results in real-time,
simplify the process of sharing and reusing workflows between the scientists, and
enable scientists to track the provenance of the workflow execution results and the workflow creation steps.
Some of the platforms giving this service: Galaxy, Kepler, Taverna, UGENE, Anduril, HIVE.


=== BioCompute and BioCompute Objects ===
In 2014, the US Food and Drug Administration sponsored a conference held at the National Institutes of Health Bethesda Campus to discuss reproducibility in bioinformatics",Bioinformatics
"Over the next three years, a consortium of stakeholders met regularly to discuss what would become BioCompute paradigm",Bioinformatics
"These stakeholders included representatives from government, industry, and academic entities",Bioinformatics
"Session leaders represented numerous branches of the FDA and NIH Institutes and Centers, non-profit entities including the Human Variome Project and the European Federation for Medical Informatics, and research institutions including Stanford, the New York Genome Center, and the George Washington University.
It was decided that the BioCompute paradigm would be in the form of digital 'lab notebooks' which allow for the reproducibility, replication, review, and reuse, of bioinformatics protocols",Bioinformatics
This was proposed to enable greater continuity within a research group over the course of normal personnel flux while furthering the exchange of ideas between groups,Bioinformatics
"The US FDA funded this work so that information on pipelines would be more transparent and accessible to their regulatory staff.
In 2016, the group reconvened at the NIH in Bethesda and discussed the potential for a BioCompute Object, an instance of the BioCompute paradigm",Bioinformatics
"This work was copied as both a ""standard trial use"" document and a preprint paper uploaded to bioRxiv",Bioinformatics

Nanotechnology is the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers (nm),Nanotechnology
"At this scale, commonly known as the nanoscale, surface area and quantum mechanical effects become important in describing properties of matter",Nanotechnology
This definition of nanotechnology includes all types of research and technologies that deal with these special properties,Nanotechnology
"It is common to see the plural form ""nanotechnologies"" as well as ""nanoscale technologies"" to refer to research and applications whose common trait is scale",Nanotechnology
"An earlier understanding of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabricating macroscale products, now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.
Nanotechnology defined by scale includes fields of science such as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage, engineering, microfabrication, and molecular engineering",Nanotechnology
"The associated research and applications range from extensions of conventional device physics to molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale.
Nanotechnology may be able to create new materials and devices with diverse applications, such as in nanomedicine, nanoelectronics, biomaterials energy production, and consumer products",Nanotechnology
"However, nanotechnology raises issues, including concerns about the toxicity and environmental impact of nanomaterials, and their potential effects on global economics, as well as various doomsday scenarios",Nanotechnology
"These concerns have led to a debate among advocacy groups and governments on whether special regulation of nanotechnology is warranted.


== Origins ==

The concepts that seeded nanotechnology were first discussed in 1959 by physicist Richard Feynman in his talk There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom, in which he described the possibility of synthesis via direct manipulation of atoms.

The term ""nano-technology"" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known",Nanotechnology
"Eric Drexler used the term ""nanotechnology"" in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale ""assembler"" that would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atom-level control",Nanotechnology
"Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute to increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.
The emergence of nanotechnology as a field in the 1980s occurred through the convergence of Drexler's theoretical and public work, which developed and popularized a conceptual framework, and high-visibility experimental advances that drew additional attention to the prospects",Nanotechnology
"In the 1980s, two breakthroughs sparked the growth of nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"First, the invention of the scanning tunneling microscope in 1981 enabled visualization of individual atoms and bonds, and was successfully used to manipulate individual atoms in 1989",Nanotechnology
The microscope's developers Gerd Binnig and Heinrich Rohrer at IBM Zurich Research Laboratory received a Nobel Prize in Physics in 1986,Nanotechnology
"Binnig, Quate and Gerber also invented the analogous atomic force microscope that year.

Second, fullerenes (buckyballs) were discovered in 1985 by Harry Kroto, Richard Smalley, and Robert Curl, who together won the 1996 Nobel Prize in Chemistry",Nanotechnology
C60 was not initially described as nanotechnology; the term was used regarding subsequent work with related carbon nanotubes (sometimes called graphene tubes or Bucky tubes) which suggested potential applications for nanoscale electronics and devices,Nanotechnology
"The discovery of carbon nanotubes is largely attributed to Sumio Iijima of NEC in 1991, for which Iijima won the inaugural 2008 Kavli Prize in Nanoscience.
In the early 2000s, the field garnered increased scientific, political, and commercial attention that led to both controversy and progress",Nanotechnology
"Controversies emerged regarding the definitions and potential implications of nanotechnologies, exemplified by the Royal Society's report on nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"Challenges were raised regarding the feasibility of applications envisioned by advocates of molecular nanotechnology, which culminated in a public debate between Drexler and Smalley in 2001 and 2003.
Meanwhile, commercial products based on advancements in nanoscale technologies began emerging",Nanotechnology
These products were limited to bulk applications of nanomaterials and did not involve atomic control of matter,Nanotechnology
"Some examples include the Silver Nano platform for using silver nanoparticles as an antibacterial agent, nanoparticle-based sunscreens, carbon fiber strengthening using silica nanoparticles, and carbon nanotubes for stain-resistant textiles.
Governments moved to promote and fund research into nanotechnology, such as American the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which formalized a size-based definition of nanotechnology and established research funding, and in Europe via the European Framework Programmes for Research and Technological Development.
By the mid-2000s scientific attention began to flourish",Nanotechnology
"Nanotechnology roadmaps centered on atomically precise manipulation of matter and discussed existing and projected capabilities, goals, and applications.


== Fundamental concepts ==
Nanotechnology is the science and engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale",Nanotechnology
"In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up making complete, high-performance products.
One nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10−9, of a meter",Nanotechnology
"By comparison, typical carbon–carbon bond lengths, or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule, are in the range 0.12–0.15 nm, and DNA's diameter is around 2 nm",Nanotechnology
"On the other hand, the smallest cellular life forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are around 200 nm in length",Nanotechnology
"By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm, following the definition used by the American National Nanotechnology Initiative",Nanotechnology
"The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which have an approximately ,25 nm kinetic diameter)",Nanotechnology
"The upper limit is more or less arbitrary, but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of",Nanotechnology
"These phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices that are merely miniaturized versions of an equivalent macroscopic device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of microtechnology.
To put that scale in another context, the comparative size of a nanometer to a meter is the same as that of a marble to the size of the earth",Nanotechnology
"In the ""bottom-up"" approach, materials and devices are built from molecular components which assemble themselves chemically by principles of molecular recognition",Nanotechnology
"In the ""top-down"" approach, nano-objects are constructed from larger entities without atomic-level control.
Areas of physics such as nanoelectronics, nanomechanics, nanophotonics and nanoionics have evolved to provide nanotechnology's scientific foundation.


=== Larger to smaller: a materials perspective ===

Several phenomena become pronounced as system size",Nanotechnology
"These include statistical mechanical effects, as well as quantum mechanical effects, for example, the ""quantum size effect"" in which the electronic properties of solids alter along with reductions in particle size",Nanotechnology
Such effects do not apply at macro or micro dimensions,Nanotechnology
"Additionally, physical (mechanical, electrical, optical, etc.) properties change versus macroscopic systems",Nanotechnology
"One example is the increase in surface area to volume ratio altering mechanical, thermal, and catalytic properties of materials",Nanotechnology
Systems with fast ion transport are referred to as nanoionics,Nanotechnology
"The mechanical properties of nanosystems are of interest in research.


=== Simple to complex: a molecular perspective ===

Modern synthetic chemistry can prepare small molecules of almost any structure",Nanotechnology
These methods are used to manufacture a wide variety of useful chemicals such as pharmaceuticals or commercial polymers,Nanotechnology
"This ability raises the question of extending this kind of control to the next-larger level, seeking methods to assemble single molecules into supramolecular assemblies consisting of many molecules arranged in a well-defined manner.
These approaches utilize the concepts of molecular self-assembly and/or supramolecular chemistry to automatically arrange themselves into a useful conformation through a bottom-up approach",Nanotechnology
The concept of molecular recognition is important: molecules can be designed so that a specific configuration or arrangement is favored due to non-covalent intermolecular forces,Nanotechnology
"The Watson–Crick basepairing rules are a direct result of this, as is the specificity of an enzyme targeting a single substrate, or the specific folding of a protein",Nanotechnology
"Thus, components can be designed to be complementary and mutually attractive so that they make a more complex and useful whole.
Such bottom-up approaches should be capable of producing devices in parallel and be much cheaper than top-down methods, but could potentially be overwhelmed as the size and complexity of the desired assembly increases",Nanotechnology
Most useful structures require complex and thermodynamically unlikely arrangements of atoms,Nanotechnology
"Nevertheless, many examples of self-assembly based on molecular recognition in exist in biology, most notably Watson–Crick basepairing and enzyme-substrate interactions",Nanotechnology
"


=== Molecular nanotechnology: a long-term view ===

Molecular nanotechnology, sometimes called molecular manufacturing, concerns engineered nanosystems (nanoscale machines) operating on the molecular scale",Nanotechnology
"Molecular nanotechnology is especially associated with molecular assemblers, machines that can produce a desired structure or device atom-by-atom using the principles of mechanosynthesis",Nanotechnology
"Manufacturing in the context of productive nanosystems is not related to conventional technologies used to manufacture nanomaterials such as carbon nanotubes and nanoparticles.
When Drexler independently coined and popularized the term ""nanotechnology"", he envisioned manufacturing technology based on molecular machine systems",Nanotechnology
"The premise was that molecular-scale biological analogies of traditional machine components demonstrated molecular machines were possible: biology was full of examples of sophisticated, stochastically optimized biological machines.
Drexler and other researchers have proposed that advanced nanotechnology ultimately could be based on mechanical engineering principles, namely, a manufacturing technology based on the mechanical functionality of these components (such as gears, bearings, motors, and structural members) that would enable programmable, positional assembly to atomic specification",Nanotechnology
"The physics and engineering performance of exemplar designs were analyzed in Drexler's book Nanosystems: Molecular Machinery, Manufacturing, and Computation.
In general, assembling devices on the atomic scale requires positioning atoms on other atoms of comparable size and stickiness",Nanotechnology
Carlo Montemagno's view is that future nanosystems will be hybrids of silicon technology and biological molecular machines,Nanotechnology
"Richard Smalley argued that mechanosynthesis was impossible due to difficulties in mechanically manipulating individual molecules.
This led to an exchange of letters in the ACS publication Chemical & Engineering News in 2003",Nanotechnology
"Though biology clearly demonstrates that molecular machines are possible, non-biological molecular machines remained in their infancy",Nanotechnology
"Alex Zettl and colleagues at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratories and UC Berkeley constructed at least three molecular devices whose motion is controlled via changing voltage: a nanotube nanomotor, a molecular actuator, and a nanoelectromechanical relaxation oscillator",Nanotechnology
"
Ho and Lee at Cornell University in 1999 used a scanning tunneling microscope to move an individual carbon monoxide molecule (CO) to an individual iron atom (Fe) sitting on a flat silver crystal and chemically bound the CO to the Fe by applying a voltage.


== Research ==


=== Nanomaterials ===
Many areas of science develop or study materials having unique properties arising from their nanoscale dimensions.

Interface and colloid science produced many materials that may be useful in nanotechnology, such as carbon nanotubes and other fullerenes, and various nanoparticles and nanorods",Nanotechnology
"Nanomaterials with fast ion transport are related to nanoionics and nanoelectronics.
Nanoscale materials can be used for bulk applications; most commercial applications of nanotechnology are of this flavor.
Progress has been made in using these materials for medical applications, including tissue engineering, drug delivery, antibacterials and biosensors.
Nanoscale materials such as nanopillars are used in solar cells.
Applications incorporating semiconductor nanoparticles in products such as display technology, lighting, solar cells and biological imaging; see quantum dots.


=== Bottom-up approaches ===
The bottom-up approach seeks to arrange smaller components into more complex assemblies.

DNA nanotechnology utilizes Watson–Crick basepairing to construct well-defined structures out of DNA and other nucleic acids.
Approaches from the field of ""classical"" chemical synthesis (Inorganic and organic synthesis) aim at designing molecules with well-defined shape (e.g",Nanotechnology
"bis-peptides).
More generally, molecular self-assembly seeks to use concepts of supramolecular chemistry, and molecular recognition in particular, to cause single-molecule components to automatically arrange themselves into some useful conformation.
Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale ""write head"" to deposit a chemical upon a surface in a desired pattern in a process called dip pen nanolithography",Nanotechnology
"This technique fits into the larger subfield of nanolithography.
Molecular Beam Epitaxy allows for bottom-up assemblies of materials, most notably semiconductor materials commonly used in chip and computing applications, stacks, gating, and nanowire lasers.


=== Top-down approaches ===
These seek to create smaller devices by using larger ones to direct their assembly.

Many technologies that descended from conventional solid-state silicon methods for fabricating microprocessors are capable of creating features smaller than 100 nm",Nanotechnology
"Giant magnetoresistance-based hard drives already on the market fit this description, as do atomic layer deposition (ALD) techniques",Nanotechnology
"Peter Grünberg and Albert Fert received the Nobel Prize in Physics in 2007 for their discovery of giant magnetoresistance and contributions to the field of spintronics.
Solid-state techniques can be used to create nanoelectromechanical systems or NEMS, which are related to microelectromechanical systems or MEMS.
Focused ion beams can directly remove material, or even deposit material when suitable precursor gasses are applied at the same time",Nanotechnology
"For example, this technique is used routinely to create sub-100 nm sections of material for analysis in Transmission electron microscopy.
Atomic force microscope tips can be used as a nanoscale ""write head"" to deposit a resist, which is then followed by an etching process to remove material in a top-down method.


=== Functional approaches ===
Functional approaches seek to develop useful components without regard to how they might be assembled.

Magnetic assembly for the synthesis of anisotropic superparamagnetic materials such as magnetic nano chains.
Molecular scale electronics seeks to develop molecules with useful electronic properties",Nanotechnology
"These could be used as single-molecule components in a nanoelectronic device, such as rotaxane.
Synthetic chemical methods can be used to create synthetic molecular motors, such as in a so-called nanocar.


=== Biomimetic approaches ===
Bionics or biomimicry seeks to apply biological methods and systems found in nature to the study and design of engineering systems and modern technology",Nanotechnology
"Biomineralization is one example of the systems studied.
Bionanotechnology is the use of biomolecules for applications in nanotechnology, including the use of viruses and lipid assemblies",Nanotechnology
"Nanocellulose, a nanopolymer often used for bulk-scale applications, has gained interest owing to its useful properties such as abundance, high aspect ratio, good mechanical properties, renewability, and biocompatibility.


=== Speculative ===
These subfields seek to anticipate what inventions nanotechnology might yield, or attempt to propose an agenda along which inquiry could progress",Nanotechnology
"These often take a big-picture view, with more emphasis on societal implications than engineering details.

Molecular nanotechnology is a proposed approach that involves manipulating single molecules in finely controlled, deterministic ways",Nanotechnology
"This is more theoretical than the other subfields, and many of its proposed techniques are beyond current capabilities.
Nanorobotics considers self-sufficient machines operating at the nanoscale",Nanotechnology
"Nevertheless, progress on innovative materials and patented methodologies have been demonstrated.
Productive nanosystems are ""systems of nanosystems"" could produce atomically precise parts for other nanosystems, not necessarily using novel nanoscale-emergent properties, but well-understood fundamentals of manufacturing",Nanotechnology
"atomic) nature of matter and the possibility of exponential growth, this stage could form the basis of another industrial revolution",Nanotechnology
"Mihail Roco proposed four states of nanotechnology that seem to parallel the technical progress of the Industrial Revolution, progressing from passive nanostructures to active nanodevices to complex nanomachines and ultimately to productive nanosystems.
Programmable matter seeks to design materials whose properties can be easily, reversibly and externally controlled though a fusion of information science and materials science.
Due to the popularity and media exposure of the term nanotechnology, the words picotechnology and femtotechnology have been coined in analogy to it, although these are used only informally.


=== Dimensionality in nanomaterials ===
Nanomaterials can be classified in 0D, 1D, 2D and 3D nanomaterials",Nanotechnology
"Dimensionality plays a major role in determining the characteristic of nanomaterials including physical, chemical, and biological characteristics",Nanotechnology
"With the decrease in dimensionality, an increase in surface-to-volume ratio is observed",Nanotechnology
This indicates that smaller dimensional nanomaterials have higher surface area compared to 3D nanomaterials,Nanotechnology
"Two dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have been extensively investigated for electronic, biomedical, drug delivery and biosensor applications.


== Tools and techniques ==


=== Scanning microscopes ===
The atomic force microscope (AFM) and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two versions of scanning probes that are used for nano-scale observation",Nanotechnology
"Other types of scanning probe microscopy have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelengths of sound or light.
The tip of a scanning probe can also be used to manipulate nanostructures (positional assembly)",Nanotechnology
Feature-oriented scanning may be a promising way to implement these nano-scale manipulations via an automatic algorithm,Nanotechnology
"However, this is still a slow process because of low velocity of the microscope.
The top-down approach anticipates nanodevices that must be built piece by piece in stages, much as manufactured items are made",Nanotechnology
Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis,Nanotechnology
Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes can be used to look at surfaces and to move atoms around,Nanotechnology
"By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures",Nanotechnology
"By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques",Nanotechnology
"


=== Lithography ===
Various techniques of lithography, such as optical lithography, X-ray lithography, dip pen lithography, electron beam lithography or nanoimprint lithography offer top-down fabrication techniques where a bulk material is reduced to a nano-scale pattern.
Another group of nano-technological techniques include those used for fabrication of nanotubes and nanowires, those used in semiconductor fabrication such as deep ultraviolet lithography, electron beam lithography, focused ion beam machining, nanoimprint lithography, atomic layer deposition, and molecular vapor deposition, and further including molecular self-assembly techniques such as those employing di-block copolymers.


==== Bottom-up ====
In contrast, bottom-up techniques build or grow larger structures atom by atom or molecule by molecule",Nanotechnology
Dual-polarization interferometry is one tool suitable for characterization of self-assembled thin films,Nanotechnology
Another variation of the bottom-up approach is molecular-beam epitaxy or MBE,Nanotechnology
Gossard developed and implemented MBE as a research tool in the late 1960s and 1970s,Nanotechnology
Samples made by MBE were key to the discovery of the fractional quantum Hall effect for which the 1998 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded,Nanotechnology
"MBE lays down atomically precise layers of atoms and, in the process, build up complex structures",Nanotechnology
"Important for research on semiconductors, MBE is also widely used to make samples and devices for the newly emerging field of spintronics.
Therapeutic products based on responsive nanomaterials, such as the highly deformable, stress-sensitive Transfersome vesicles, are approved for human use in some countries.


== Applications ==

"Most applications are ""first generation"" passive nanomaterials that includes titanium dioxide in sunscreen, cosmetics, surface coatings, and some food products; Carbon allotropes used to produce gecko tape; silver in food packaging, clothing, disinfectants, and household appliances; zinc oxide in sunscreens and cosmetics, surface coatings, paints and outdoor furniture varnishes; and cerium oxide as a fuel catalyst.
In the electric car industry, single wall carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) address key lithium-ion battery challenges, including energy density, charge rate, service life, and cost",Nanotechnology
"SWCNTs connect electrode particles during charge/discharge process, preventing battery premature degradation",Nanotechnology
"Their exceptional ability to wrap active material particles enhanced electrical conductivity and physical properties, setting them apart multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon black.
Further applications allow tennis balls to last longer, golf balls to fly straighter, and bowling balls to become more durable",Nanotechnology

"Also, to build structures for on chip computing with light, for example on chip optical quantum information processing, and picosecond transmission of information.
Nanotechnology may have the ability to make existing medical applications cheaper and easier to use in places like the doctors' offices and at homes",Nanotechnology
"Cars use nanomaterials in such ways that car parts require fewer metals during manufacturing and less fuel to operate in the future.
Nanoencapsulation involves the enclosure of active substances within carriers",Nanotechnology
"Typically, these carriers offer advantages, such as enhanced bioavailability, controlled release, targeted delivery, and protection of the encapsulated substances",Nanotechnology
"In the medical field, nanoencapsulation plays a significant role in drug delivery",Nanotechnology
"It facilitates more efficient drug administration, reduces side effects, and increases treatment effectiveness",Nanotechnology
"Nanoencapsulation is particularly useful for improving the bioavailability of poorly water-soluble drugs, enabling controlled and sustained drug release, and supporting the development of targeted therapies",Nanotechnology
"These features collectively contribute to advancements in medical treatments and patient care.
Nanotechnology may play role in tissue engineering",Nanotechnology
"When designing scaffolds, researchers attempt to mimic the nanoscale features of a cell's microenvironment to direct its differentiation down a suitable lineage",Nanotechnology

Researchers used DNA origami-based nanobots capable of carrying out logic functions to target drug delivery in cockroaches.
A nano bible (a .5mm2 silicon chip) was created by the Technion in order to increase youth interest in nanotechnology.


== Implications ==

One concern is the effect that industrial-scale manufacturing and use of nanomaterials will have on human health and the environment, as suggested by nanotoxicology research",Nanotechnology
"For these reasons, some groups advocate that nanotechnology be regulated",Nanotechnology
"However, regulation might stifle scientific research and the development of beneficial innovations",Nanotechnology
"Public health research agencies, such as the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health research potential health effects stemming from exposures to nanoparticles.
Nanoparticle products may have unintended consequences",Nanotechnology
Researchers have discovered that bacteriostatic silver nanoparticles used in socks to reduce foot odor are released in the wash,Nanotechnology
"These particles are then flushed into the wastewater stream and may destroy bacteria that are critical components of natural ecosystems, farms, and waste treatment processes.
Public deliberations on risk perception in the US and UK carried out by the Center for Nanotechnology in Society found that participants were more positive about nanotechnologies for energy applications than for health applications, with health applications raising moral and ethical dilemmas such as cost and availability.
Experts, including director of the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies David Rejeski, testified that commercialization depends on adequate oversight, risk research strategy, and public engagement",Nanotechnology
"As of 206 Berkeley, California was the only US city to regulate nanotechnology",Nanotechnology
"


=== Health and environmental concerns ===

Inhaling airborne nanoparticles and nanofibers may contribute to pulmonary diseases, e.g",Nanotechnology
"Researchers found that when rats breathed in nanoparticles, the particles settled in the brain and lungs, which led to significant increases in biomarkers for inflammation and stress response and that nanoparticles induce skin aging through oxidative stress in hairless mice.
A two-year study at UCLA's School of Public Health found lab mice consuming nano-titanium dioxide showed DNA and chromosome damage to a degree ""linked to all the big killers of man, namely cancer, heart disease, neurological disease and aging"".
A Nature Nanotechnology study suggested that some forms of carbon nanotubes could be as harmful as asbestos if inhaled in sufficient quantities",Nanotechnology
"Anthony Seaton of the Institute of Occupational Medicine in Edinburgh, Scotland, who contributed to the article on carbon nanotubes said ""We know that some of them probably have the potential to cause mesothelioma",Nanotechnology
"So those sorts of materials need to be handled very carefully."" In the absence of specific regulation forthcoming from governments, Paull and Lyons (2008) have called for an exclusion of engineered nanoparticles in food",Nanotechnology
"A newspaper article reports that workers in a paint factory developed serious lung disease and nanoparticles were found in their lungs.


== Regulation ==

Calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have accompanied a debate related to human health and safety risks",Nanotechnology
"Some regulatory agencies cover some nanotechnology products and processes – by ""bolting on"" nanotechnology to existing regulations – leaving clear gaps",Nanotechnology
"Davies proposed a road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.
Andrew Maynard, chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, reported insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result inadequate understanding of human health and safety risks",Nanotechnology
"Some academics called for stricter application of the precautionary principle, slowing marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data.
A Royal Society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that ""manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure"".
